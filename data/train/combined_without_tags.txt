ï»¿1 We're not...
who...
we are.
We're not...
who we are.
It goes no further than this.
It stops right here...
right now.
Team captain John Richter here.
It's been a couple of frustrating months,
but after a great deal of stick-with-it-ness
we're very proud to report that,
as of a half an hour ago,
we surpassed the previous record
for drilling down into an ice sheet.
All right!
This team of scientists made up
the Arctic Ice Core Project.
They were sent to Alaska
by the government's Advanced Research Project Agency
nearly a year ago to drill into the Arctic ice.
The samples they removed
contained trapped gases, dust, chemicals--
evidence that could reveal
the structure of the earth's climate
back to the dawn of man.
Their work was a success, nearly completed.
No reports or indications of problems of any kind
until only a week later
this next transmission was received.
We're not...
who...
we are.
We're not...
who we are.
It goes no further than this.
It stops... right here...
right now.
What happened up there?
So far nobody's been able to reach the compound
because of bad weather.
Obviously they think
we're either brilliant or expendable
because we've pulled the assignment.
Is it severe isolation distress?
These were top geophysicists.
They were trained and screened for this project
in every way imaginable,
including psychological makeup.
We leave for Nome today.
We'll meet up with three scientists
familiar with the Ice Core Project
and then head north up to the Icy Cape.
The National Weather Service
reports a three-day window
to get in and get out before the next Arctic storm.
Bring your mittens.
Here's the snap. Raiders blitz.
Fouts dumps it across the middle to Winslow.
He's at the 15! The ten! Touchdown-- San Diego!
Touchdown!
Fouts is God!
Sorry, my team scored.
There's no football on Wednesday.
Fouts retired in '87, didn't he?
No, this is just some of my
all-time favorite plays on tape.
You two FBI?
Agent Mulder, Agent Scully. And you?
Danny Murphy, professor of geology, U.C. San Diego.
San Diego-- you get much of a chance to study ice down there?
Just what's around the keg.
Dr. Dasilva, Dr. Hodge?
Yeah, sorry we're late.
Agent Scully, Agent Mulder.
Mulder. Nice to meet you.
How you doing, Mr. Mulder? Dr. Murphy.
What for?
Want to make sure we are who we say we are.
It's me.
It's you.
It's me.
It's you.
It's me. Thanks a lot.
Well, now that we know who we are,
anybody care to take a guess as to why we're going?
Well,
two federal agents, a geologist,
a medical doctor, and a toxicologist.
That should give us some idea what they're thinking.
I assume you all took a look at the tape.
Something wrong?
Come on, you're FBI.
You have to know more than we do.
You folks the ones going up to Icy Cape?
Yeah.
Then I'm the one flying you.
My name is Bear.
The plane's across the way.
Provisions are loaded.
Grab your gear.
Oh, could we see some credentials?
Credentials.
The only credentials I have
is that I'm the only pilot willing to fly you up there.
You don't like those credentials,
walk.
Bear, see if you can get the power started.
Anything to get out of here.
Where do we start?
Body bags are on the plane.
Before we touch anything,
we have to thoroughly document the scene.
Flashing.
That's what they were drilling for.
Quarter of a million years melting away
in a couple of days.
I want to preserve some samples.
It's the generator.
Oh.
Agent Mulder!
Hold on.
Hold it down.
That will keep him out for a while.
You okay?
Yeah, he didn't break the skin.
Bear, you okay?
He got me.
Get that jacket off.
Give me the stuff. I'll do it myself.
Is it rabies?
I don't see any indication of glottal spasm or tetany.
If it is rabies,
it's certainly not a strain I'm familiar with.
Look at this.
Black nodules.
Swollen lymph nodes.
Symptoms of bubonic plague.
I'll do a blood test.
We'll take it from there.
This dog has got
a skin irritation on its neck.
It looks like it's been scratching off
its own hair.
Look at this, look at this.
What the hell was that?
From the autopsies
it's clear these men killed one another.
There are contusions
around the throat areas of three men--
evidence of strangulation.
Richter and Campbell killed themselves.
I also found tissue damage due to fever.
Did any of them have
the black spots the dog has?
No.
None of them had the black nodules.
So, uh, those spots didn't have anything to do
with those guys killing each other, right?
I wouldn't rule it out.
I just reexamined the dog.
The nodules are gone.
What could that mean?
It could mean that the spots are a symptom of some disease
at an early stage.
Danny?
Sorry.
The playoff game against Miami, '82.
Helps to get my mind off stuff.
My interpretation of satellite remote sensing photos
is a little rusty.
All right, this is the Icy Cape area.
It approximates the depth of the ice sheet
to be about 3,000 meters thick.
I also found this data,
and if I'm reading it correctly,
the team actually found the ice sheet
to be twice that depth.
That's very good.
The numbers indicate
the topography to be concave.
Looks like they were drilling
inside a meteor crater.
No, you're wrong, it's impossible.
I analyzed two samples.
What did you find?
There seems to be a presence of ammonium hydroxide
in Richter's blood sample.
It's not possible.
Ammonia would vaporize at human body temperature.
I checked all the air filtration systems.
I found no evidence of any such toxins.
I have.
In the ice,
and that's not all there is.
I found a high ratio of ammonia to water
in the ice core.
The earth's atmosphere
could never have produced such levels,
not even a quarter of a million years ago.
Look in the scope.
Unless a foreign object
was introduced into that environment.
Tell me that's not a foreign object.
Whoa.
Scully.
That same thing is in Richter's blood.
What if that single-celled organism
is the larval stage of a larger animal?
That's kind of a leap, don't you think?
The evidence is there.
Maybe the organism
in the ice core somehow got into the men.
Come on, nothing can survive in subzero temperatures
for a quarter of a million years.
Unless that's how it lives.
Lookit, I don't see why you're squabbling over some bug.
You said it yourself, Scully, your autopsy found
those men killed each other.
That's it, now I say, let's just get the hell out of here.
I agree, we can have the bodies sent
to a facility where they can make a definitive diagnosis
in the event
that something was missed, Agent Scully.
If those bodies are infected
with an unknown organism,
we can't take them back.
We can't go back
without proper quarantine procedures.
We can't risk bringing back the next plague.
Let's say you're right, they came down with something.
We haven't, and I ain't waiting around until we do.
I think it's safe to go back.
There's no reason why we'd be infected.
We've taken all the necessary biological safeguards.
The dog did bite Bear.
There's only one way to proceed.
A doctor eliminates every possibility.
We must determine if any of us is infected.
All right. Parasitic diagnostic procedure
requires that each of us provide a blood and a stool sample.
A stool sample? Wow.
This kind of travel always makes that kind of tough... for me.
Okay, anybody got
the morning sports section handy?
I ain't dropping my cargo for no one.
What I'm doing is getting
my gear, getting my plane, and flying the hell out of here.
You can't go.
The dog bit you.
I got hired to fly you up here and fly you back.
No one said this might be part of the deal.
So the deal is over.
We can't let him leave without him being checked.
Who's going to stop him?
We have to.
We can't risk infecting the population.
If he gets on that plane, I'm gonna be on it with him.
Well, we don't have time to argue about it.
Take a vote.
Whoever believes we should confine Bear
until he agrees to an examination...
All right.
Bear, we just want to check you out.
If we don't find any trace
of the parasite or the virus,
we'll all go.
All right.
Give me the damn jar.
Murphy, get a rope.
Right.
Here.
Oh, my God.
Oh.
Get my bag.
We don't know enough about it. It's killing him.
Scully, help me hold the skin.
Hold still, Bear.
Forceps.
Hold still, Bear.
Just another second.
You're going to be okay.
This is the AICP investigative team
calling Doolittle Airfield.
Come in.
DAF responding.
This is Agent Mulder.
We have a serious biological hazard.
Request air pickup and quarantine procedures.
Over.
Come in, Doolittle Airfield.
We copy, Agent Mulder.
This area is under a heavy storm,
and no aircraft can get out for the next day.
Maybe the military base in Kotzebue
can set up a quarantine.
Advise immediate evacuation.
The Arctic storm is bearing in your direction. Over.
We were told we'd have three clear days of weather. Over.
Welcome to the top of the world, sir. Over.
Is Bear in any condition to fly?
If we don't get out of here in an hour,
we don't get out for days.
He's dead.
Well, it's similar to a tapeworm
in that it has a scolex with suckers and hooks.
So, then, it's familiar,
something you can deal with.
What?
No.
Very different from any organism--
at least that I know of.
Have you figured out how it's transmitted yet?
Exchange of fluids, touch, air, all of the above?
I don't know.
All the other dead bodies had the creature.
This is the only one that's still alive.
All in the spine?
No, it appears they were in the hypothalamus gland
deep in the brain.
Hypothalamus.
What was that again?
It's a gland that secretes hormones,
although I don't know why
a parasite would want to attach to it.
Hypothalamus releases acetylcholine,
which is what produces violent, aggressive behavior,
so that might be a connection.
Everybody that's been infected
certainly seems to act aggressively.
Maybe the worm feeds on acetylcholine,
which floods our capacity to control violent behavior.
Well, a parasite shouldn't want to kill its host.
No, it doesn't kill you until it's extracted.
Then it releases a poison.
So you're saying it's possible
that the worm makes you want to kill other people,
which is maybe what happened to the first team.
Or what could happen to us.
It's just a theory.
We don't have any definite proof.
Except five dead men.
If the worm makes people violently aggressive,
then why did Richter and Campbell kill themselves?
Maybe they did it to save us.
I'm just, uh... double-checking.
Making sure I didn't miss anything.
Just some sleep, right?
Sleep. I'm so tired, I can't sleep.
Well, we're all wired and hypersensitive.
It will be good to get a fresh start in the morning.
Mulder, I don't want to waste a second
trying to find a way to kill this thing.
I don't know if we should kill it.
This area of the ice sheet is formed over a meteor crater.
The worm lives in ammonia, it survives subzero temperatures.
Theorists in alternative life designs believe
in ammonia-supported life systems
on planets with freezing temperatures.
No.
The meteor that crashed here
a quarter of a million years ago may have carried
that type of life to Earth.
Mulder, that pilot developed surface symptoms
within a few minutes.
Within a few hours
that parasite had total control.
What would happen if this got into the population?
A city the size of New York
could be infected within a few days.
Exactly, but what do we know about it?
This organism might be lying dormant in another crater.
Mulder, if we don't kill it now, we run the risk
of becoming Richter and Campbell with guns to our heads.
But if we do kill it now, we may never know
how to stop it or anything like it in the future.
Future?
Mulder, how can you talk about the future?
Tell me it's hot in here.
Don't worry, you don't have a fever.
The heating system is malfunctioning.
Outside it's 40 below, and in here it's sweltering.
Can you hear what they're arguing about?
Oh, they're probably discussing
their little government secrets.
You think they knew it was up here before we arrived?
I'm sure of it.
You know, Bear's infected blood did get on Scully.
It also got on you.
How do you know it can't be contained?
It can, by extermination.
We should take those bodies--
worms and all-- outside and incinerate them.
Something going on we should know about?
Agent Scully, you all right?
Yes, I'm fine.
It's nothing.
You seem a little bit stressed out.
What the hell are you trying to say?
Let's all just settle down.
It's been a long, hard day.
We're all tired and scared.
Let's not turn on one another.
At least not without a good reason.
Maybe we should all get some sleep.
You kidding?
You think any of us could sleep right now?
Guys, let's face it-- we got to check for spots.
Any person or persons who has them
should be confined.
Are we agreed on that?
Are you going to do the exams?
No.
We do them in front of each other.
No secrets.
Before anyone passes judgment,
may I remind you we are in the Arctic?
Yeah?
Sleep tight.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
Yeah, good night.
Good night, Mulder.
Good night, Scully.
At least everyone's okay.
Don't forget,
the spots on the dog went away.
Mulder, what are you doing?
Murphy's dead.
You killed him.
I found him like this.
I heard one of the doors close.
I came out to check it out.
It was one of you.
No, he said he didn't do it.
I don't have any of the symptoms.
You checked him yourself, Hodge.
Yeah, six hours ago.
It was one of you. Stop it!
Stop it! Shut up!
Mulder, just
put the gun down and let Hodge
give you a blood test.
So he can doctor the results? I'm not gonna
let him stick a needle in me.
He could be infected.
He has to be confined now.
Then just turn around
and let us take a look at your neck.
I'm not turning my back on anyone!
As far as I'm concerned,
you're all infected!
Hodge is right-- we ought to lock him up.
Mulder.
Scully, get that gun off me.
Mulder,
you have to understand.
Put it down!
You put it down first!
Scully!
For God's sakes, it's me.
Mulder, you may not be who you are.
In here I'll be safer than you.
What were you doing?
You know what I was doing.
You know,
I can't help thinking, Agent Scully,
you're the only one with a gun.
If you get infected, we don't stand a chance, do we?
Good.
Was there something there?
You're okay, Nancy.
We're all okay.
Now is not the time for the three of us
to break down and turn on each other.
There's four of us.
Mulder isn't one of us anymore.
If Mulder is infected, it's not his fault.
We can't turn our backs on him now.
He needs us to help him.
She's right.
Who knows
what prolonged exposure to the parasite could do to him?
It could damage him to the point of permanent psychosis.
But if he is infected, he doesn't go back.
I won't risk the possibilities.
This is AICP calling Doolittle Airfield.
Please come in.
This is the Arctic Ice Core Project
sending a general distress call.
Please respond.
Nancy, want to put a drop of the uninfected blood
on the slide of the blood drawn from the pilot?
Run that by me again.
Put the uninfected blood on the infected blood.
No! Damn it!
What did I just get through telling you?
You just infected already infected blood.
Now I have to start all over again.
I made a mistake. You don't have to yell at me.
Wasted hours of work... Okay, well, then
maybe you should just do it by yourself!
Damn it! God, I'm not your assistant!
All you do is... Oh, just get out of here.
Go take a shower or something.
Hodge.
What?
Come take a look at this.
The larvae from two different worms
killed each other.
An individual worm will not tolerate another
invading its host.
It does to the invader what it did to humans.
It makes them kill.
Doesn't make any sense for a species to kill its own.
It needs another to procreate.
Worms are hermaphroditic.
It can reproduce itself.
Look at the evidence in the microscope.
This thing does not like company.
So, what are you saying?
The way to kill it
is to introduce another worm
into an already infected body?
It sounds okay.
It passed the worms in its stool.
They're dead.
I want to talk to him first.
Try and make this voluntary.
What?
You can't go in alone.
If anything happens, you come inside.
I can't do this to him until I'm sure.
It's just you?
Yes.
It's one of them.
No one's been killed since you've been in here.
So?
We found a way to kill it.
Two worms in one host will kill each other.
You give me one worm, you'll infect me.
If that's true,
then why didn't you let us inspect you?
I would have, but you pulled a gun on me.
Now I don't trust them.
I want to trust you.
Okay.
But now they're not here.
This is the last one.
She's not going to let us give it to him.
Well, she'll have to if he's infected.
He'll convince her somehow.
I just examined him.
He's uninfected.
So is she.
Which means that it must be one of you.
All right.
Let's go over to the main building.
I'd like to check him myself.
Then he can examine both of us.
Want to lead the way?
No!
Get the worm.
Don't!
No!
Oh, my God.
Mulder,
it's her!
No!
No!
Scully!
It's Dasilva.
No!
Hodge! Now!
Mulder.
After this, there won't be any left.
They're all going to be dead!
Do it!
It's all right.
It's all over.
It all stops right here,
right now.
Okay, I got it.
Okay, lock her down.
She's being put in quarantine along with the dog.
We'll keep her there until we're sure
that she won't infect the rest of the population.
Meanwhile our tests came back normal,
so we've been released.
Plane ready.
It'll take you as far from the ice
as you want to go.
I'm going back to the site.
This time I'm going fully prepared
with proper equipment.
There's still a lot of research to be done
on the genetic structure, on its origins...
Wait, Mulder, don't you know?
Know what?
45 minutes after they evacuated us,
they torched the place.
There's nothing left.
Who did that?
The military,
Centers for Disease Control.
You ought to know.
They're your people.
It's still there, Scully.
200,000 years down.
In the ice.
Leave it there.

(Growls)
(Dull Pop)
(Slow, Heavy Breathing)
(Snapping And Cracking)
Eugene?
Eugene, it's Dr. Monte.
Eugene, areyou asleep?
- No. - I was on myway out
and I wanted to see howyou were feeling.
Fine.
Good. You nervous about tomorrow?
Don't be.
I knowyou think theywon't letyou out
so I snuck a peek at the reports ofthe doctors
that will testify atyour review tomorrow
and they concurwith my opinion that you're ready to be released from here
and rejoin the community.
So...
why don't we get some sleep and relax
and I'll seeyou tomorrow at the review, okay?
Let'sjust keep our fingers crossed.
Agent Scully.
We have reviewed your reports, and frankly, we are quite displeased.
Irregular procedure, untenable evidence
inconclusive findings aggravated byvague opinion.
But, sir, the very nature ofthe X-files cases
often precludes orthodox investigation.
Areyou suggesting the Bureau adopt separate standards foryou and Mulder?
No, sir. Ifanything, I'm suggesting
that these cases be reviewed with... an open mind.
Maybeyour mind has become too open.
On X-files cases investigated by Agent Mulder and myselfto date
we have a conviction or case solution of75%.
That's well above current Bureau standard.
And that is your only saving grace.
May I ask, sir, what moreyou require?
What I require
is increased frequency ofreports
conventional investigation.
In short, Agent Scully, it is your responsibility
to see that these cases are by the book.
I understand. However...
conventional investigation ofthese cases
may decrease rate ofsuccess.
(Gavel Pounding)
judge: By order ofthe State of Maryland
the Court shall review the psychological status
of Eugene VictorTooms.
We'll begin with the court-appointed expert witnesses.
Court calls Dr. Pamela Karetzky.
I performed several diagnostic procedures on Mr. Tooms
in order to determine any organic physiological dysfunction--
an electroencephalogram, chromosomal analysis
a computerized axial tomograph.
All ofthese were negative.
" Mr. Tooms had recently lost hisjob.
"Aggravated by a false arrest incident with the F.B.I.,
"his assault on Agent Scullywas
'frustration directed at the wrong person."'
I'm reading from a recent interview
I did with Mr. Tooms at the Druid Hill Sanitarium.
"Question: lfyou are released
"what is the first thing you would do?
"Answer: I'd like my oldjob back.
"Question: Why?
"Answer: The animal shelter
"made me feel I was helping everyone--
people and animals."
So, you see, what is occurring here is that Mr. Tooms has learned
to articulate his feelings and invest his emotional energy
towards creative and constructive activity...
(No Audio)
...in himself.
It is my opinion that Mr. Tooms has had a very excellent response
to the months oftreatment and therapy.
I would see no reason why he would be considered
ofany danger to himselfor society.
Woman: ...is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
I do.
I'm a special agent with the F.B.I.
I worked for threeyears at the F.B.I.'s behavioral science unit
profiling serial killers.
Your Honor, I know where he's going with this.
May I remind the Court Mr. Tooms was placed in psychiatric care
solely for the assault on Agent Scully.
He has never been charged, nor has any evidence linked him to any other crime.
judge: Proceed... with caution.
Myers: Agent Mulder, I understand
thatyou've developed a profile on Mr. Tooms.
- Yes, I have. - Please.
These murders span nearly a century.
1 9 homicides-- five occurring every 30 years since 1 903
all in the Baltimore area.
In each case, the liverwas extracted
and presumably eaten.
A trophywas taken from each victim, many ofwhich were found
in the living quarters of Eugene Tooms at 66 Exeter Street.
Records show that a Eugene Tooms has resided
at that same address since 1 903--
the sameyear a man was murdered in that building.
The most notable element connecting these cases
is the undetermined point ofentry.
These fingerprints found at seven ofthe 1 9 crime scenes
match Eugene VictorTooms.
Agent Mulder, look at his fingers.
- Look at him. 1 00 years old? - I contend that perhaps
through a genetic mutation Tooms is capable ofcontorting
and elongating his body to gain access to victims
so he may extract the livers which provide him sustenance
for the hibernation period of30 years.
He needs one more victim to complete this cycle.
A preliminary exam revealed abnormalities
in his stride, muscles, and axial bones.
His attorney blocked further study.
- I askyou to place the safety... - No further questions.
This is a rare and abnormal human creature who should not be released.
It's in his genetic makeup.
Would they have taken me more seriously ifl wore the grey suit?
Mulder, your testimony-- you sounded--
I don't care how it sounded, as long as it was the truth.
And where wereyou? Your testimonywas important.
I was called into a meeting byAssistant Director Skinner.
What did he want?
just wanted to reel me in.
They're ready.
It is the opinion ofthis Court
that Eugene VictorTooms
shall on this day be released from the Druid Hill Sanitarium.
Court also attaches these conditions:
One, that he remain in counseling under the care of Dr. Aaron Monte--
that he may retain hisjob at the Baltimore Regulations Animal Shelter
and last, he take residence in the house of Mr. and Mrs. Arlan Green
trained in a program to assist patients released from Druid Hill
in their transition to society.
Mr. Tooms?
Doyou understand and accept these conditions?
Yes, Your Honor.
Verywell. You're free to go.
I'm not taking my eyes offhim.
He'll kill again first chance he can, but he won't kill the old couple.
Tooms didn't remain a secret for 1 00 years by not being careful.
Think ofhim as an animal. He kills out ofnecessity or self-defense.
Ifhe makes an attempt, I'll be there.
I'll keep surveillance with you.
Ifhe can't be tied to recent evidence
go to the earlier murders to prove it was him.
That was 30 or 60 years ago.
There's no statute oflimitation on murder.
That's going to entail
unorthodox methods ofinvestigation.
Ifyou're resistant becauseyou don't believe
I'll respect that, but ifyou're resistant
because ofbureaucratic pressure, they've not only reeled you in
they've skinned you.
(Door Opening)
Arlan: I hopeyou'll be comfortable, Eugene.
The room in the back is small
but I'm sureyou'll be able to squeeze in.
Tooms: I'm sure.
(Growling And Snarling)
Excuse me.
Could you help me find my dog?
He's a Norwegian elkhound.
His name is Heinrich.
I use him to hunt moose.
IfTooms gets away now
then the next time he takes a life
you'll be nearly my age.
Detective Briggs, you helped us so much before.
Now we have to prove that Tooms was involved
in the killings you investigated 30 years ago.
You've lived with this case halfyour life.
There must be something.
Maybe a connection between the victims.
Now, I know that we've seen all ofthe evidence
but is there anything, anything at all
amongst the evidence that does not fit?
There was something
that never did sit quite right with me.
All ofthe victims that I investigated in '63
were found at the crime scene, liver extracted.
All five.
As were the four most recent murders.
When I was a sheriff
during the Powhatan Mills killings of 1 933
only four ofthe victims were found at the crime scene.
However, there was a fifth person
who was missing and never found
but this--
this was discovered at the Ruxton Chemical Plant
when it was under construction.
But it doesn't belong to the othervictims.
That doesn't prove it belongs to a person murdered byTooms.
I'm positive Tooms hid this one victim
because something about the body could prove he was the killer.
- What makes you positive? - A hunch.
An old-fashioned hunch.
You've got to trust your instincts.
And what does your instinct say
about where Tooms buried the body?
In the cement where they poured the foundation
ofthe chemical plant.
(MachineryWhirring)
Scully: Ground-penetrating radar.
It bounces signals off ofobjects or cavities.
Tells you where the body is.
Well, it signals ifsomething inordinate is present.
An experienced operator attempts to differentiate
ifthe signal is a body or a stone or a hole in the ground.
- Differentiate. - Mm-hmm.
You mean he guesses.
Well, it's an educated guess.
Mm-hmm.
How are we doing?
Well, it's really hard to tell.
It's here. Here!
What is it?
It's here! It's right here!
(Deep Breath)
(Jackhammer Hammering)
Agent Scully! Look at this.
(Computer Keyboard Clicking)
Woman: Robotoddler's finally sleeping.
I'm gonna watch TV in bed.
Okay.
(Vehicle Approaching)
(Baby Crying)
I'm coming, honey.
Mommy's right here.
Shh, shh.
Screw it.
(Grunts)
(Knocking)
Christine: Honey, would you go down and get that?
(Sighs)
F.B.I.
- I suspect an intruder in your house. - What?
Someone opened mywindow.
I suspect theyear ofdeath to be in the mid-1 930s.
Anterior surface ofthe right femurwas green
indicating a long-term exposure to copper
so we concentrated on the area
and we found several pennies.
1 933, '31 , 1 933.
Can you determine cause ofdeath?
My instinct says that burial in cement is murder.
Uh, no. At the moment
I have found no definite proofofmurder.
There are gnawing marks near the ribs.
However, I suspect that's the result ofrodent activity
prior to the body being set in the cement.
We need to see much more ofthe remains to determine cause ofdeath.
As you know, it's a slow, but necessary process.
I did try a little something.
It's a little premature ifwe're going by the book.
Well, we'll keep it offthe record.
Good. Thankyou. The old man, Mr. Briggs,
This is not official
but that skeleton was that person.
It's not enough. It doesn't tie it to Tooms.
Well, it's a start.
Mulder, it's getting a bit ripe in here, don'tyou think?
(Sniffs)
(Plastic Wrapper Crinkling)
Pine scented.
(Sniffs)
Whew!
(Sniffs) Better?
Tooms hasn't come out ofthe house all day.
When it got dark, I took a walk around the block.
Doyou have that sandwich I asked you to bring?
It's liverwurst.
Ha-ha.
Mulder, you know that proper surveillance
requires two pairs ofagents-- one pair relieving the other after 1 2 hours.
Article 30, paragraph 8.7?
This isn't about doing it by the book.
This is aboutyou not having slept for three days.
You're going to get sloppy and you're going to get hurt.
A request for other agents to stake out Tooms would be denied.
Well, then I'll stay here. You go home.
(Sighs)
They're out to put an end to the X-files, Scully.
I don't know why, but any excuse will do.
I don't really care about my record
butyou'd be in trouble just sitting in this car
and I'd hate to seeyou carry an official reprimand
in your career file because ofme.
- Fox. - (Chuckles)
And l... I even made my parents call me Mulder.
So... Mulder.
Mulder, I wouldn't put myself on the line for anybody butyou.
Ifthere's an iced tea in that bag, could be love.
Must be fate, Mulder.
Root beer.
You're delirious. Go home and get some sleep.
Here. Take my sandwich.
I only had one bite. You're going to want it later.
And call me ifanything happens, immediately. I'll be here.
Oh, and 1 1 :30, station 790--
Pete Rose Late Night Sports Talk radio show.
Wouldn't miss it for the world.
(Car Starts)
It has worked, hasn't it?
You'll be all right now. I know it's worked!
(Screams)
Yeah, they found him out cold in the street.
He's been beaten up pretty badly.
Contusions, multiple lacerations.
Shoulder's been pulled right out ofjoint.
Let's get him prepped for some blood work and X rays.
Orderly: Yes, Doctor.
He's been kicked in thejaw
and it may be fractured.
Look, there's a partial shoe print.
Doyou know who did this toyou?
(Whispering)
We'll be right back, Mr. Tooms.
Says it was an F.B.I. agent named Mulder.
So would you say he's delusional orjust schizophrenic?
Well, it'sjust a cursory exam, but there's nothing to indicate that.
(Grunts)
(Knocking)
(Sighs)
- Agent Mulder? - Yeah.
What's going on?
What's this about?
Agent Mulder, getyour things.
You're in some trouble.
These are serious allegations.
The evidence is incriminating.
A good forensic scientist would know there is not only a shoe print
but also an impact point ofa foot from inside the shoe.
An analysis ofTooms' injurywould show that my foot was not inside the shoe.
Areyou suggesting Tooms is framing you?
- Ofcourse. - Ifyou were engaged in an unauthorized
surveillance ofTooms
how could he gain access toyour shoe withoutyou seeing him?
Sir? I was engaged
in the unauthorized surveillance as well
and Agent Mulder was orienting me
on the situation at the time Tooms was admitted into the hospital.
Agent Mulder could not have done it because he was with me.
Agent Scully, you wouldn't be lying to me, would you?
Sir, I would expectyou
to place the same trust in me as I do in you.
Agent Scully, may I have a word with Agent Mulder, please?
Fox...
you are one ofthe finest, most unique agents
in the nearly 60-year history ofthis institution.
I mean, we were talking aboutyou when you were in the academy.
Now, most ofus feel thatyour talents are wasted on the X-files
but we respect thatyou're deeply invested in those areas.
But ifthese cases are creating such stress
as to cause not onlyyou to act inappropriately
but those agents close toyou as well
then may I adviseyou to step away... for a while?
Clearyour head, take an extended vacation.
That's a good idea.
Thanks foryour concern.
You're forbidden to go near Eugene Tooms.
Mulder...
this was close.
Any closer and a thousand friends at the capitol won't be able to helpyou.
Scully: These are Eugene Tooms' dental X rays
obtained from the Druid Hills Sanitarium.
Your sandwich gave me an idea.
Dr. Plith mentioned he found gnawing
on the rib cage near the location ofthe liver.
Further excavation revealed more pronounced bite marks--
human teeth marks.
Tooms will nevervoluntarily submit to a dental cast.
This software can create an exact three-dimensional model
ofTooms' mouth from the dental radiograph.
We've also mapped out the bite marks
on the skeleton's rib, there.
They match.
(Knocking)
- Eugene, Dr. Monte. - Hi, Eugene.
I wanted to see how everything was going.
Arlan: Susan and I are going out for the evening.
Thanks.
Great place. Wonderful place.
How areyou feeling?
Why the newspapers strips, Eugene?
Areyou making some paper-mache?
- Yes. - That's terrific.
Wonderful. I had no idea you were interested in art.
I like art.
I do too, and I'm very proud ofyou.
You know, art can provide a window toyour thoughts and your feelings.
What areyou doing, Eugene?
Eugene, areyou all right?
(Dr. Monte Screaming)
That makes five.
Where he's gone for the last 90 years: 66 Exeter Street.
Mulder: Thanks.
He's got to be here.
Ifhe is drawn to this location for some reason
maybe this nest is in the approximate location ofthe previous nest.
This is the area.
There's a storage facility on the second foor.
What?
Scully: There's only room for one.
You can get the next mutant.
Mulder!
(Growling)
Mulder!
(Growling)
Mulder! Here. Take my hand!
Come on. You can reach it! Mulder!
Mulder, what's happening?
Quick!
(Growling)
(Screaming)
You read this report?
Doyou believe them?
Ofcourse I do.
Okay. Let's go.
It's amazing how things change, isn't it?
The caterpillar?
No. A change for us. It's coming.
How doyou know?
A hunch.

[ woman crying ]
Lauren, l've been looking ev...
Areyou all right?
Doyou want some water?
No. l'm fine.
Oh, honey, it's been a couple ofweeks now.
Doyou want to talk?
No. Really,Jane, l'm okay.
l just haven't known
a lot ofpeople who have died, you know.
l've never known anybody that killed themselves.
Maybe once everything gets packed away
it will get easier.
There won't be the constant reminder.
Here's your paycheck.
Come on. Go home.
Okay.
[ electronicbeeping ]
[ screaming ]
Oh, please!
Oh, please!
l have no money!
[ screaming ]
Please, l have no money!
Let me go!
[ screaming ]
Food.
[ coughs ]
l think l'll pass.
Hey, l know a good place to crash.
Up the fire escape
Through that window.
Come on. l'll giveyou a boost.
Pull it down.
l can't get it down.
Come on, pull.
Come on! Come on!
Agent Scully, Agent Mulder
Chief Blevins assures us ofyour cooperation.
We regret any inconvenience at this extreme hour.
We hopeyour expertise in extraordinary phenomenon
will help us answer some questions.
You're not F.B.l., areyou?
Haveyou ever analyzed anything like this before?
Abnormal postmortem muscle refex.
Both corpses are still responding
to exposure to high levels
ofelectrostatic charge.
Any external lesions or surface burns?
None.
Time ofdeath?
Well, it can't be long.
The body's still warm.
Somatic death occurred sometime over six hours ago
but their body temperatures haveyet to drop below 98.3.
Where did you find them?
Look, at least tell us
the time and mode oftransport.
That might help us determine why the bodies
haven't cooled.
You guys called us down here.
You want some answers
you got to give some.
They traveled 60 minutes by air.
Thankyou.
The most troubling aspect ofthe deaths
is the throat area.
Larynx, esophagus, and hyoid bone--
all have been crushed
like chalk.
No abrasions, or evidence oftissue damage.
lt's as iftheir throats were crushed
from the inside.
Who are these guys?
why areyou consulting us?
Working on the X-Files
haveyou seen anything like this?
No, never.
Well, thankyou very much foryour time
Agent Mulder, Scully.
lfany inquiry as to this meeting be made
we request full denial.
l'd sayyou people already suffer from full denial.
You lied.
You have seen it before. l can tell.
You lied to them.
l would never lie.
l willfully participated
in a campaign ofmisinformation.
Who doyou think theywere?
N.S.A., C.l.A., some covert organization
that Congress will uncover in the next scandal.
lt's not important who they are
but what they have.
l'm sure they have no idea, because they called us in.
l have X-Files--
each case has an element ofwhat we saw tonight.
Residual electrostatic charge, internal mutilation--
none has the elements combined in one case.
How can an esophagus be crushed without the neck being touched?
Psychokinetic manipulation.
Psychokinesis?
You mean how Carrie got even at the prom?
The Russians were doing studies on it.
The Chinese still are.
Their findings are kept secret.
Okay, l'm intrigued but how can we investigate?
We have nothing to go on.
just getting in, Lauren?
Oh!
Mr. Graves used to letyou get awaywith that
but Mr. Dorlund is in charge now.
l was wondering ifl could have
a minute with him?
Tomorrow... at 3:00.
[ sighs ]
Oh!
Oh!
ls everything all right out here?
Can l speakwith you?
Please.
Um, l'm here to give my two-week notice.
Uh-huh...
Lauren,Jane told me
aboutyou crying in Howard's office
and l wantyou to know you're not alone.
As a matter offact, we share something special.
Howard and l started this company
ten years ago.
As long as l knew him
he had no interest in anything besides work.
So, some ofus
became family.
l was his brother.
You were like a daughter.
So, ofcourse
l feel very close toyou
and l...
l want to take care ofmy family.
Stay, Lauren, please.
The company needs you.
Especially now.
l won't letyou leave, Lauren.
What's wrong?
[ gaspingandgrunting ]
l, uh... l can't.
l have to leave.
l can't be here anymore.
You've got two weeks.
Mohammed Amrahlabi.
"Convictions: lllegal possession offirearms
illegal possession ofexplosives
falsification ofexport licenses."
He has ties to an extremist group in the U.S.--
the lsfahan
named after the city in lran.
They're working out of Philadelphia.
That's 60 air minutes.
l'll talk to the Philly P.D.
Officer: This is where
we found him.
Who discovered their bodies?
Nobody.
lt was about 1 0:00; l was on patrol.
just saw them hanging around.
No witnesses?
The kind ofpeople
who come around here after business hours
don't witness very much.
You know what l'm saying.
We'll just question everyone on record
who was at the machine before 1 0:00 that night.
There.
l'll back up.
Lauren Kyte. 858 Franklin, Bensalem.
Whywould the lsfahan be robbing someone of40 bucks
at an ATM machine?
Look at that.
Maybe it's another person.
Maybe. Maybe not.
Well, the resolution's too poor.
lt won't help much to enhance it.
That leaves us only one person
we know we can talk to.
Oh, come on.
[ knockingatdoor ]
[ knocking ]
Hello?
Ms. Lauren Kyte, please.
l'm agent Fox Mulder.
This is Agent Dana Scully.
We're with the Federal Bureau oflnvestigation.
Maywe come in?
l was in the middle...
We won't be long.
Thankyou.
Haveyou ever seen either ofthese two men before?
No.
Takeyour time.
l'm sorry.
l've never seen them before.
l'm afraid you have.
Can you tell us what happened that night?
Um...
These guys, l...
l was depositing my paycheck.
They grabbed me, l got away, l ran.
l just didn't want to file a report.
Theywere found dead.
Haveyou ever seen this person before?
No.
l'm sorry. l can't tell you.
Does that mean you know?
Uh... lt means l...
l can't tell you who it is.
Well, when you can tell me
this is the number
l can be reached at any time, okay?
Mm-hmm.
A woman her size breaking free
and outrunning those men?
Then somehow crushing their necks?
Scully: She knows who
the other person in the photo is.
She's packing, running away, but from what?
[ tiressquealing ]
What's happening? What the hell's going on?
Mulder: Hang on!
Areyou okay?
Yeah.
Hi.
Hi.
The paramedics checkyou out?
Yeah. l'm fine, although l do have
a standing-in-line- at-the-DMV-sized headache.
Mine's more l.R.S.-sized.
Did they check out the car?
lt's brand-new. only 1 00 miles.
Then someone tampered with it
while we were in her house.
The mechanic says everything's in proper order.
Nothing cut, nothing greased.
Check out the lights.
They're on.
No. The filaments are heated
due to massive levels ofelectrostatic charge
just like the bodies in the morgue.
And isn't it interesting that Lauren Kyte
was present at both incidents?
She was in our presence the entire time.
What ifit's possible
to raise the body's electrostatic charge
to the levels we've been seeing
and use that energy to affect objects?
lfa person generated that much energy
their body would break down.
They'd glow like those lights.
There's evidence ofthis in the X-Files--
furniture moving untouched
objects levitating
unexplained electrical discharges.
Frequently, people who have psychokinetic power
are unaware oftheir own capability.
Areyou saying Lauren Kyte crashed our car?
Either that...
or a poltergeist.
They're here.
They may be.
Mulder, look at
the tangible evidence.
Two mideast extremists were killed
trying to assault a woman
working for a manufacturer ofparts
for the Defense Department.
When we questioned her, our carwas sabotaged.
ln both cases, someone else may have committed those acts--
Maybe the same someone from the ATM photos.
The mystery isn't psychokinetic energy.
lt's her accomplice.
Excuse me.
She's clean. No arrest, not even a traffic ticket.
The only thing is
she's in deep with her credit card company-- 1 5,000.
What doyou think you're doing?
No, no. l'll take care ofthis, all right?
Here. l'll talk to somebody.
wouldn'tyou say?
Who is Howard Graves, anyway?
She was his secretary.
That's three people dead in the last month
associated with Lauren Kyte.
You won't find too many people
at their boss' grave who aren't dancing on it.
Look at this one.
[ watersplashing ]
Excuse me, sir?
ls there an office
where l can get some information
on those people?
Who? l attend every funeral.
l'm the last person to see them put to rest.
Doyou know how Sarah Lynn
was related to Howard Graves?
His daughter.
Theywere at home one day
and he didn't latch the pool gate.
She drowned.
His wife left him a year later.
She's buried in a plot in the northeast corner.
Thankyou, sir.
You're welcome.
She was only threeyears old.
lfshe had lived, she'd be Lauren's age.
revealsan estrangement from herfamily.
Heractions, observedduringsurveillance,

andheremployer, thelate Howard Graves.
ifatall?
Iam certain theanswers to these questions...
lie in fiinding theidentity ofLauren Kyte'saccomplice.
Enhance it by ten.
That's Howard Graves.
He's alive.
Not necessarily.
[ hissing ]
[ stairs creaking ]
[ muffledvoice ]
Man:Don'tdo this tome.
Howard.
Howard:No. Stop. No, no!
Please, no!
[ moaning ]
[ sobbing ]
[ panickedgasping ]
Lauren:Howard.
Theykilledhim.
l think Howard Graves fabricated his own death.
Doyou know how difficult it is
to fakeyour own death?
Only one man has pulled it off-- Elvis.
He and Lauren Kyte are in on something.
Maybe an illegal dealing through his company--
something the C.l.A. was interested in.
You may be right.
Wait.
You think l'm right?
Sure. All you got to do
is prove Howard Graves is still alive.
Howard Graves is very dead.
Maywe see the autopsy report, please?
Knockyourselfout.
Uh... "Cause ofdeath, arterial hemorrhage..."
Bledsoe: Four out ofsix liters ofblood
down the tub.
Well, there seems to be some blood work missing here.
We only do that ifwe suspect homicide.
l don't supposeyou ran any dental confirmations?
What for? lt was him.
How did you know?
lt said so on the toe tag.
Who made positive l.D. on the body?
Um...
Lauren Kyte.
Mulder: But he was cremated.
There's no way to run a dental check
or get a DNA sample.
Yes, there is.
His body's tissues and organs were donated.
They harvested the organs immediately after death.
His kidneys were sent to Boston
his liver to Dallas
and his corneas to Portland, Oregon.
They've all been transplanted.
Because ofhis age
we could only cryopreserve the dura matter
in the membrane ofthe spinal column.
We have Mr. Graves' hospital records.
We'll extract a sample, run a test
l, uh, made them rush soyou could haveyour check
beforeyou leave.
Oh. l'm going to miss you.
Oh.
Oh, what?
Here.
Good-bye.
[ doorcloses ]
You were going to leave
without saying good-bye?
Well, uh, l came to say good-bye
and to wish you luck...
and to leaveyou with this little thought.
l know Howard told you
and ifit ever gets out
l won't waste my time trying to pin the source.
l'll go straight toyou.
And you'll do to me whatyou did
to Howard?
l knowyou had him killed.
Whywould you say that?
He told me.
[ telephoneringing ]
Mulder.
How soon can you
be at my house?
Why?
Please hurry.
The tests are conclusive.
The dura matter does belong to Howard Graves.
He is, indeed, very dead.
[ knocking ]
just a second.
[ screaming ]
Go run the bath.
Get out ofhere!
No!
No!
[ screaming ]
No. No!
[ choking ]
No!
[ Laurenscreaming: ] No!No!
[ mangasping ]
[ Lauren crying ]
You know, you're not under arrest.
You'rejust here for questioning.
The sooner you talk to us
the sooner you get to go home.
What happened
to those people tonight?
Doyou have any idea who they might be?
Why did they attackyou?
Doyou know who this is?
Scully, Mulder.
He'll keep an eye on her.
Come on. Now.
You've seriously compromised our investigation.
We were following leads pertaining to an X-File.
l want to know every detail ofyour activities
concerning this case.
You're the ones who have been
withholding information.
Why don'tyou tell us whatyou've got?
Then we have nothing more to talk about.
Wait! We believe H.T.G.
lndustrial Technologies sold restricted parts
to the lsfahan.
Serial numbers were recovered in the wreckage
ofthe bombing ofa navy transport van.
How is Lauren Kyte involved?
Your actions impeded our investigation.
We don't have enough evidence to hold her.
lfshe doesn't talk, she goes free
and we lose our chance to break this company.
l could make her talk.
My advice toyou: don't get rough with her.
That was a waste oftime.
Your turn.
Lauren...
l won't talk toyou either.
Okay. Then you're free to go.
l can't go back to that house.
Why?
Because of Howard Graves?
He's dead.
l know.
He's watching overyou, isn't he?
Sometimes your boss can talk
as ifyou weren't even in the room
which can hurt, you know.
Sometimes you're all he has to talk to
which is how it always was with me and Howard.
One night, late, l went into his office.
He was crying, more scared than sad.
The Pentagon contracts were being canceled.
The companywas going under.
He felt personally responsible for each ofhis employees.
Seeing and feeling their fear every day
reallywore him down.
Then this one time, Dorlund came with that group--
that mideast group-- lsfahan.
They'd buy parts at an outrageous price--
notjust once--
for as long as they could get awaywith it.
That night Howard was crying, he hadjust found out
that lsfahan had claimed responsibility
for killing a couple sailors in Florida.
He was never the same
and l thought that's why he killed himself...
but he didn't.
l saw...
Howard showed me how Dorlund had him killed.
Made it look like a suicide, 'cause he could see
Howard was going to put an end to the deal.
So now Howard is protecting you?
lt sounds so ridiculous.
Butyou believe it?
He was closer to me than my father.
l told him that.
l still feel his presence.
Sometimes... l even smell his after-shave.
lfyoujust could have... seen the things l've seen.
l just want all that to go away.
That's why l'm leaving.
Maybe he can move on.
That's not enough.
You have been given the chance to tell him again.
Take it.
Tell him you love him by showing him...
by... by helping us finish his unfinished business.
Lauren, how will you ever
be able to rest ifhe never can?
Okay.
l'm a mess.
l'm going to, uh... wash up.
What areyou doing, Scully?
You don't believe.
Mulder, there's no such things as ghosts or psychokinesis.
l'm sure there's an explanation, but l believe that she believes
and my priority is to get her to help us stop Dorlund.
Well, we may havejust sacrificed our best opportunity
to observe spectral phenomena.
No, l'm giving us the chance to solve a case that's tangible
instead ofchasing after shadows.
[ dooropensandshuts ]
Areyou ready?
All right, everyone
we have a warrant to search the premises
for evidence pertaining to the sale
ofrestricted manufactured parts.
The evidence may be in the form
offalsified export licenses, parts manifests, communiques.
lt could be on computer disk or hard copy.
Once there, ifin doubt, ask.
We need this to be clean.
This is the culmination ofa yearlong investigation.
lfwe don't come out ofthere todaywith something
proving a connection to the lsfahan
this guy could walk.
Okay, let's go.
You okay?
lt will most likely be in Dorlund's office.
We'll execute the search, but we'll need you to guide us
soyou have to be strong, okay?
Scully: Everybody stay calm.
Federal Bureau oflnvestigation.
Ma'am, could you back away from those files, please?
This is all we could find.
We don't have him.
He's not even breaking a sweat.
Webster: Our case is blown.
We've wasted a year.
This guy's going to walk.
Let's get out ofhere.
Mulder: Lauren, it's over. we have to go.
What we're looking for isn't here.
Dorlund: She's no agent.
l've been more than cooperative.
She has no right
to destroy my personal property.
What about that van that blew up and killed those servicemen?
l don't know whatyou're talking about
you stupid bitch!
Lauren, no!
Lauren: Don't kill him!
Help us find it!
[ lights explode ]
Mulder!
Oh, my god.
Mulder: l guess what we're looking for is here.
The U.S. Attorney's Office
is going after Dorlund with everything they've got
including the murder of Howard Graves.
l'll come back to testify.
Whereyou going?
Away from here.
[ enginestarting ]
Thanks.
Boy, she's in a rush to get out ofhere.
Out ofhere, or away from the ghost of Howard Graves?
Hey, Scully, doyou believe in an afterlife?
l'd settle for a life in this one.
You ever seen the Liberty Bell?
Yes.
l've been to Philadelphia 1 00 times
and l've never seen it.
You're not missing much.
lt's a big bell with a big crack
and you have to wait in a long line.
I'dreallylike togo.
Whynow?
Idon'tknow.
Howlate doyou think theystay open?
Miss Kyte, l asked for this 25 minutes ago.
l know. l'm sorry.
Maybe that's the way theywork back East
but here in the Midwest, punctuality is a virtue.
We really have to find a new office space.
Every time a truck goes by
the whole building shakes.
That's all, Lauren.

No visible cause.
No sign of battery or sexual assault.
All we have is this.
Can we turn her over?
Karen Swenson.
Is that a positive ID?
She went to school with my son.
That would be the class of '89, Detective?
It's happening again, isn't it?
Agent Dana Scully.
Come in.
Agent Scully, thank you for coming on such short notice.
Please...
We see you've been with us just over two years.
Yes, sir.
You went to medical school, but you chose not to practice.
How did you come to work for the FBI?
Well, sir, I was recruited out of medical school.
Um, my parents still think it was an act of rebellion
but I saw the FBI.
As a place where I could distinguish myself.
Are you familiar with an agent named Fox Mulder?
Yes, I am.
How so?
By reputation.
Um, he's an Oxford-educated psychologist
who wrote a monograph on serial killers and the occult
that helped catch Monte Propps in 1988.
Generally thought of as the best analyst
in the violent crime section.
He had a nickname at the academy:
"Spooky" Mulder.
What I'll also tell you
is that Agent Mulder
has developed a consuming devotion
to an unassigned project outside the Bureau mainstream.
Are you familiar with the so-called X Files?
I believe they have to do with unexplained phenomena.
More or less.
The reason you're here, Agent Scully,
is we want you to assist Mulder on these X Files.
You will write field reports on your activities
along with your observations
on the validity of the work.
Am I to understand
that you want me to debunk the X Files project, sir?
Agent Scully, we trust
you'll make the proper scientific analysis.
You'll want to contact Agent Mulder shortly.
We look forward to seeing your reports.
Sorry, nobody down here
but the FBI's most unwanted.
Agent Mulder.
I'm Dana Scully.
I've been assigned to work with you.
Oh, isn't it nice to be suddenly so highly regarded?
So, who did you tick off
to get stuck with this detail, Scully?
Actually, I'm looking forward to working with you.
I've heard a lot about you.
Oh, really?
I was under the impression that you were sent to spy on me.
If you have any doubt
about my qualifications or credentials...
You're a medical doctor.
You teach at the academy.
You did your undergraduate degree in physics.
"Einstein's Twin Paradox--
A New Interpretation."
Dana Scully's senior thesis.
That's a credential: rewriting Einstein.
Did you bother to read it?
I did. I liked it.
It's just that, in most of my work,
the laws of physics rarely seem to apply.
Maybe I can get your medical opinion on this, though.
Oregon female, age 21.
No explainable cause of death.
Autopsy shows nothing. Zip.
There are, however, these two distinct marks
on her lower back.
Dr. Scully, can you ID these marks?
Needle punctures, maybe.
An animal bite, electrocution of some kind.
How's your chemistry?
This is the substance found in the surrounding tissue.
It's organic.
I don't know.
Is it some kind of synthetic protein?
Beats me.
I've never seen it before, either,
but here it is again in Sturgis, South Dakota,
and again in Shamrock, Texas.
Do you have a theory?
I have plenty of theories,
but maybe what you can explain to me
is why it's Bureau policy
to label these cases as "unexplained phenomena"
and ignore them.
Do you believe in the existence of extraterrestrials?
Logically, I would have to say no.
Given the distances needed to travel from
the far reaches of space,
the energy requirements would exceed
a spacecraft's capabilities.
Conventional wisdom.
Do you know this Oregon female--
she's the fourth person in her graduating class
to die under mysterious circumstances.
Now, when convention and science
offer us no answers, might we not finally
turn to the fantastic as a plausibility?
The girl obviously died of something.
If it was natural causes, it's plausible
there was something missed in the postmortem.
If she was murdered,
it's plausible there was a sloppy investigation.
What I find fantastic is any notion
that there are answers beyond the realm of science.
The answers are there.
You have to know where to look.
That's why they put the "I" in FBI.
See you tomorrow morning, Scully, bright and early.
We leave for the very plausible state of Oregon
at 8:00 a.m.
I'd like to ask all passengers to fasten their seat belts
as we're about to make our descent...
Please remain calm.
Are you all right?
Please remain seated.
This must be the place.
You didn't mention yesterday
this case has already been investigated.
Yeah, the FBI got involved after the first three deaths
when local authorities failed to turn up any evidence.
Our boys came out here, spent a week,
enjoyed the local salmon
which, with a little lemon twist
is just to die for, if you pardon the expression.
Without explanation, they were called back in.
The case was reclassified and buried in the X Files
till I dug it up last week.
And you found something they didn't.
The autopsy reports of the first three victims
show no unidentified marks or tissue samples,
but those reports were signed by a different medical examiner
than the latest victim.
That's pretty good, Scully.
Better than you expected, or better than you hoped?
Well, I'll let you know
when we get past the easy part.
Is the medical examiner a suspect?
We won't know that until we do a little grave digging.
I've arranged to exhume one of the other victim's bodies
to see if we can get a tissue sample to match the girl's.
You're not squeamish about that kind of a thing, are you?
I don't know, I've never had the pleasure.
What's going on?
What the hell was that about?
Oh, you know, probably nothing.
Mr. Mulder, John Truitt, county coroner's office.
Yeah, hi.
This is Agent Scully. Hi.
How soon can we get started?
We're ready to go. Hello.
Oh, great. Excuse me.
Were you able to arrange for an examination facility?
Excuse me.
Excuse me. No.
Please stay in...
I just don't know who you people think you are.
You just think you can come up here
and do whatever you damn please, don't you?
I'm sorry. You are...?
I'm Dr. Jay Nemman.
I'm county medical examiner.
Surely, you must have been informed of our intentions
to come up here. No. No, we've been away.
Oh, oh. Well, that answers a question that we had:
why you hadn't done the recent autopsy on Karen Swenson.
You're aware of the tissue sample
that was taken from the girl's body.
Wh-what is the insinuation here?
We're not insinuating anything, sir.
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! See, well, I think you are.
And if you're making an accusation,
then you'd better have something to back it up.
Daddy, please, let's just go home.
Let's go home, please!
Guy obviously needed a longer vacation.
Ray Soames was the third victim.
After graduating high school,
he spent time in a state mental hospital
treated for post-adolescent schizophrenia.
Soames actually confessed to the first two murders.
He pleaded to be locked up
but he couldn't produce any evidence
that he committed the crimes.
Did you happen to read the cause of death?
Exposure. His body was found in the woods
after escaping the hospital.
Missing for only seven hours in July.
How does a 20-year-old boy die of exposure
on a warm, summer night in Oregon, Dr. Scully?
I got it.
This isn't official procedure.
Really?
It's probably a safe bet Ray Soames never made
the varsity basketball team.
Seal this up right now.
Nobody sees or touches this. Nobody.
This is amazing, Scully.
Do you know what this could mean?
It's almost too big to even comprehend.
Subject is 156 centimeters in length,
weighing 52 pounds in extremis.
Corpse is in
advanced stages of decay and desiccation.
Distinguishing features include large ocular cavities.
Oblate cranium
indicate subject is not human.
Could you point that flash away from me, please?
If it's not human, what is it?
It's mammalian.
My guess is it's a chimpanzee
or something from the ape family,
possibly an orangutan.
Buried in the city cemetery in Ray Soames' grave?
Try telling that to the good townsfolk
or to Ray Soames' family.
I want tissue samples and x rays.
I'd like blood typing, toxicology
and a full genetic work-up. You're serious?
What we can't do here, we'll order to go.
This is somebody's sick joke.
We can do those x rays here, can't we?
Is there any reason we can't do them right now?
I'm not crazy, Scully.
I have the same doubts you do.
Visual laboratory inspection of the body
and x-ray analysis confirms homologous
but possibly mutated mammalian physiology.
However, does not account for small, unidentified object
found in subject's nasal cavity:
a gray, metallic implant...
Who is it?
Steven Spielberg.
I'm way too wired. I'm going for a run.
You want to come?
Pass. Did you figure out
what that little thing up Ray Soames' nose is yet?
No. And I'm not
losing any sleep over it.
Good night.
Ray Soames was a patient of mine, yes.
I oversaw his treatment for just over a year
for clinical schizophrenia.
Ray had an inability to grasp reality.
He seemed to suffer from some kind of post-traumatic stress.
Is that something you've seen before?
I've treated similar cases.
Were any of those Ray Soames' classmates?
Yes.
We're trying to find a connection in these deaths.
Did you treat any of these kids with hypnosis?
No. I did not.
Are you treating any of these kids now?
Currently?
Yes, I'm treating Billy Miles and Peggy O'Dell.
Both have been long term live-in patients.
They're here at this hospital?
That's right. Going on four years now.
Would it be possible for us to talk to them?
Well, you might find it difficult.
Certainly in Billy Miles' case.
Billy's experiencing what we call a waking coma.
Functionally, his brain waves are flat
and he's persistent vegetative.
How did it happen?
Both he and Peggy were involved in an automobile accident
out on State Road.
Peggy?
Peggy, we have some visitors.
Would you like to talk with them for a moment?
Billy wants me to read now.
Does he like it when you read to him?
Yes.
Billy needs me close.
Doctor,
I'm wondering if we can do a cursory medical exam
on Peggy?
Peggy, what are you doing?
No one is going to hurt you.
Get an orderly!
Get an orderly! Nobody's going to hurt you.
It's all right.
Peggy, honey, you're going to be fine.
Now, calm down.
You know that you will be all right.
What's-his-name, Billy, said he was sorry
he didn't get to say good-bye.
How did you know that girl was going to have the marks?
I don't know. Lucky guess?
Damn it, Mulder, cut the crap.
What is going on here?
Why, so you can put it down in your little report?
I don't think you're ready for what I think.
I'm here to solve this case, Mulder.
I want the truth.
The truth?
I think those kids have been abducted.
By who?
By what.
You don't really believe that.
Do you have a better explanation?
I'll buy that girl is suffering
some kind of pronounced psychosis.
Whether it's organic or the result of those marks
I can't say,
but to say that they've been riding around in flying saucers,
it's crazy, Mulder.
There is nothing to support that.
Nothing scientific, you mean.
There has got to be an explanation.
You've got four victims.
All of them died in or near the woods.
They found Karen Swenson's body in the forest in her pajamas
ten miles from her house.
How did she get there?
What were those kids doing out there in the forest?
Mulder?
Mulder, is that you?
Mulder?
Special Agent Dana Scully, FBI.
Drop your weapon.
I'm with the county sheriff's department.
You're trespassing on private property here.
We are conducting
an investigation.
Get in your car and leave, both of you,
or I'll have to arrest you.
I don't care who you are.
Hold on. This is a crime scene.
Did you hear what I said?
You are on private property without legal permission.
Now, I'm only going to say it one more time.
Get in your car
and leave.
What's he doing out here all by himself?
Maybe it has something to do with this.
What do you think it is?
I don't know.
Is it a campfire?
It was all over the ground.
I think something's going on out here.
Some kind of a sacrifice, maybe.
What if these kids are involved
in some kind of a cult
and that man knows something about it?
I want to come back here.
You okay, Mulder?
Yeah. I'm just, uh...
What are you looking for?
What happened?
We lost power.
Brakes, steering, everything.
We lost nine minutes.
Whoo!
We lost what?
Nine minutes!
I looked at my watch just before the flash
and it was 9:03.
It just turned 9:13.
Look.
Look!
Oh, yes!
Abductees.
People that have made UFO sightings.
They've reported unexplained time loss.
Come on.
Gone!
Just like that.
No, wait a minute.
You're saying that... that time disappeared.
Time can't just disappear.
I-i-it's a universal invariant.
Not in this zip code.
Great.
Hi.
I want you to look at something.
Come on in.
What are they?
Mulder, what are they?!
Mosquito bites.
Are you sure?
Yeah. I got eaten up a lot myself out there.
You okay?
Yes.
You're shaking.
I need to sit down.
Take your time.
I was 12 when it happened.
My sister was eight.
She just disappeared out of her bed one night.
Just gone. Vanished.
No note, no phone calls, no evidence of anything.
You never found her.
It tore the family apart.
No one would talk about it.
There were no facts to confront,
nothing to offer any hope.
What did you do?
Eventually, I went off to school in England.
I came back, got recruited by the Bureau.
Seems I had a natural aptitude
for applying behavioral models to criminal cases.
My success allowed me a certain freedom
to pursue my own interests
and that's when I came across the X Files.
By accident?
At first, it looked
like a garbage dump
for UFO sightings, alien abduction reports,
the kind of stuff that most people laugh at
as being ridiculous, but I was fascinated.
I read all the cases I could get my hands on.
Hundreds of them. I read everything I could
about paranormal phenomena, about the occult, and...
What?
There's classified government information
I've been trying to access
but someone has been blocking my attempts to get at it.
Who? I don't understand.
Someone at a higher level of power.
The only reason I've been allowed to continue
with my work is because I've made connections in congress.
And they're afraid of what,
that you'll leak this information?
You're part of that agenda, you know that.
I'm not a part of any agenda.
You've got to trust me.
I'm here just like you-- to solve this.
I'm telling you this, Scully, because you need to know
because of what you've seen.
In my research, I've worked very closely
with a man named Dr. Heitz Werber
and he's taken me through deep regression hypnosis.
I've been able to go into my own repressed memories
to the night my sister disappeared.
I can recall a bright light outside
and a presence in the room.
I was paralyzed,
unable to respond to my sister's calls for help.
Listen to me, Scully.
This thing exists.
But how do you know?
The government knows about it
and I got to know what they're protecting.
Nothing else matters to me,
and this is as close as I've ever gotten to it.
Hello?
What?
Who is this?
Who is th...?
That was some woman
and just said Peggy O'Dell was dead.
The girl in the wheelchair?
Yeah, I'll bring it over in a minute.
We're going to be a couple more hours, Bob.
What happened?
She ran right out in front of me.
Who are you?
She was running?
On foot?
Well, that's just... Let's go. Let's go.
I need to ask you a couple questions...
Someone trashed the autopsy bay in the lab
and they stole the body.
We're going back to the motel.
What?! They stole the corpse?
FBI.
There goes my computer.
Damn it!
The x rays and pictures!
I need a couple of men out here.
We'll need a light safety curtain.
My name is Theresa Nemman.
You've got to protect me.
Come with us.
This is the way it happens.
I don't know how I get out there.
I'll just find myself out in the woods.
How long has it been happening?
Ever since the summer we graduated.
It's happened to my friends, too.
That's why I need you-- to protect me.
I'm scared I might die
like the others.
Like... Peggy did tonight.
Your father's the medical examiner.
You were the one on the phone.
You told me Peggy O'Dell had been killed.
Theresa, your father knows about this, doesn't he?
About what happens?
Yes.
But he said never to tell
anyone about any of it.
Why?
He wants to protect me.
He thinks he can protect me, but I don't think he can.
Do you have the marks, Theresa?
Yes.
I'm going to die, aren't I?
I'm going to be next.
No, you're not going to die.
Oh, God.
Let's go home, Theresa.
Theresa, come on.
Come on, honey.
I don't think she wants to leave.
I don't care what you think.
She's a sick girl.
Your father wants to take you home.
He'll get you all cleaned up.
Going to take you where you'll be safe, Theresa.
Detective Miles and I won't let anything
happen to you, I promise.
You're Billy Miles' father?
That's right, and you stay away from that boy.
Ah, you got to love this place.
Every day is like Halloween.
They know, Mulder.
They know who's responsible for the murders.
They know something.
Dr. Nemman's been hiding medical evidence
from the beginning.
He lied on the autopsy reports.
And now we find out about the detective.
Who else would have reason to trash the lab and our rooms?
Why would they destroy evidence?
What would they want with that corpse?
I don't know.
Makes you wonder what's in those other two graves.
They're both empty.
What is going on here?
I think I know who did it.
I think I know who killed Karen Swenson.
Who?
The detective?
The detective's son.
Billy Miles.
The boy in the hospital?
The vegetable?
Billy Miles?
A boy who's been in a coma for the last four years
got out here and dug up these graves?
Peggy O'Dell was bound to a wheelchair
but she ran in front of that truck.
Look, I'm not making this up.
It all fits the profile of alien abduction.
This fits a profile?
Yeah, Peggy O'Dell was killed at around 9:00.
I think that something happened in that nine minutes.
I think that time, as we know it, stopped
and something took control over it.
You think I'm crazy.
What?
Peggy O'Dell's watch stopped a couple of minutes after 9:00.
I made a note of it when I saw the body.
The the reason the kids come to the forest,
because the forest controls them and summons them there.
And the marks are from some kind of tests
that's being done on them
and that maybe causes some kind of genetic mutation
which would explain the body that we dug up.
And the force summoned Theresa Nemman's body
into the woods tonight.
Yes, but it was Billy Miles who took her there.
Summoned by some alien impulse.
That's it.
Come on. Let's get out of here.
Where are we going?
We're going to pay a visit to Billy Miles.
Now, we could stand here until the second coming
waiting for Billy to get out of this bed.
It ain't going to happen.
He blinks and I know about it.
I guess you changed his bedpan last night.
Nobody else here's going to do it.
You noticed nothing unusual?
Do you remember what you were doing last night
around 9:00?
Probably watching TV.
Yeah.
Do you remember what you were watching?
Um, let's see...
You know, I don't really remember what I watched.
Miss...
What is she looking for?
Mulder, take a look at this.
Do you know who was taking care of Peggy O'Dell last night?
Not me.
It's not my ward, not my aisle of the produce section.
I do have a job of my own to do.
What is she doing now?
Thank you for your time, ma'am.
Okay.
Good day.
That kid may have killed Peggy O'Dell.
I don't believe this. Scully...
It's crazy.
He was in the woods.
You're sure? This is the same stuff
that I took a handful of in the forest.
Okay, well, then maybe we should take it and run a lab test...
We lost the original sample in the fire.
What else could it be?
All right, but I just want you to understand
what it is you're saying.
You said it yourself!
Yeah, but you have to write it down
in your report.
You're right.
We'll take another sample from the forest
and run a comparison before we do anything.
The detective's here.
What do you think?
You wouldn't listen to me.
I told you to stay out of this.
Hold it. Hold it right there!
You got no business out here.
There were screams.
Down on the ground.
Now!
You know it's Billy.
You've known it all along.
I said down on the ground.
How long are you going to let it happen?
He's going to kill her.
Billy!
No!
Let her go.
Leave her alone.
Dad?
Billy.
Oh, God.
Scully.
Mulder, what happened?
There was a light.
It was incredible.
If you can hear me, raise your right hand.
Tell me about the light, Billy.
When did you first see the light?
In the forest.
We were all in the forest having a party.
All my friends.
We were celebrating.
What were you celebrating?
Graduation.
And then the light came.
It took me away to the testing place.
They would tell me to gather the others
so that they could do tests.
They put something in my head.
Here.
I would wait for their orders.
Billy, who gave the orders?
The light.
They said it would be okay.
No one would know.
But the tests didn't work.
They wanted everything destroyed.
They said they were leaving.
I'm afraid.
I'm afraid they're coming back.
Don't be afraid, Billy.
We're here to help you. All right, let's go.
Nothing can hurt you now.
What we've just witnessed,
what we've read in your field reports,
the scientific basis and credibility
just seem wholly insupportable.
You're aware of that?
Yes, sir.
My reports are personal and subjective.
I don't think I've gone so far as to draw any conclusion
about what I've seen.
Or haven't seen, as seems to be the case.
This, uh... time loss,
you did or did not experience it?
I can't substantiate it, no.
What exactly can you substantiate. Agent Scully?
I see no evidence
that justifies the legitimacy of these investigations.
There were, of course, crimes committed.
Yes, but how do you prosecute a case like this?
With testimony given under hypnosis
from a boy who claims that he was given orders
from some alien force
through an implant
in his nose.
You have no physical evidence.
This is the object
described by Billy Miles
as a communication device.
I removed it
from the exhumed body.
I kept it in my pocket.
I ran a lab test on it.
The material could not be identified.
Agent Mulder-- what are his thoughts?
Agent Mulder believes we are not alone.
Thank you, Agent Scully.
That will be all.
Hello.
Scully? It's me.
I haven't been able to sleep.
I talked to the DA's office in Raymond County, Oregon.
There's no case file on Billy Miles.
The paperwork we filed is gone.
We need to talk, Scully.
Yes.
Tomorrow.

(power saw whirring)
Hurry and get him out of there!
I need two men on the left side now.
Wait. Where you goin' with him?
He's dead.
There's a woman over there who isn't
and she needs some oxygen.
Boy: I want you to rise!
Rise up and heal!
What the hell you doing?
Boy's laying on hands.
Rise up
and accept the miracle
He's given you.
You don't understand. The man's dead.
Then the boy can't possibly do any harm, can he?
For this
is the power of belief--
the power to separate the light from the darkness
to create life from death.
Amen.
Show's over!
Let's clear the area.
Hallelujah, Samuel. Hallelujah.
(singing gospel)
Yes, indeed, praise God!
Yes! Yes! Yes!
I want everybody to say hallelujah!
(congregation:) Hallelujah!
Praise the Lord!
The woman on the table has a malignant tumor on her spine.
This boy here will attempt
to heal her by simply laying his hands on her.
Where did you get this?
From the regional office in Tennessee.
The preacher's name is...
Reverend Calvin Hartley.
You've heard ofhim.
The boy is his adopted son, Samuel.
He claims to have found him as an infant
Iying in the tall weeds near the muddy Mississippi.
He also claims the boy brought a man back from the dead.
It's more than a claim.
The man he saved appears as a regular attraction
in the reverend's tent ministry.
The boy's been performing miracles
every week for the past ten years, twice on Sunday.
Not according to the Kenwood sheriff.
Local authorities think
Reverend Hartley and his son are a scam.
They've been trying to shut them down
but without any luck.
They've turned to the FBI to try and get a prosecution.
Forwhat? Fraud?
No. Murder.
Watch the tape.
Lucy Kelly has the cancer.
Her doctors say it is inoperable.
They say it is incurable.
But I say to you
that what the doctors cannot cure
the Lord can.
(congregation:) Amen!
Yes, indeed. Praise God.
Because God...
can work... miracles.
- Yes, Lord. - Praise God.
The clear light of God's healing love...
is fowing...
through Samuel's healing hands...
20 minutes later, Lucy Kelly was rushed to the hospital.
She was pronounced dead on arrival.
What caused her death?
I don't know, but it wasn't cancer.
They've requested someone
with a medical background to assist local police.
I know it's not an X file...
When do we leave for Tennessee?
I think I saw some of these same people at Woodstock.
Mulder, you weren't at Woodstock.
I saw the movie.
You all right by yourself?
I'll be fine.
I won't be long.
Okay.
(sighing)
Hartley: Most of you here today I know as neighbors
and as cherished members ofour Miracle Ministry.
But some ofyou have come from far away...
as far away
as Pensacola, Florida...
(cheering)
and Uniondale, Long lsland!
Wayne Ashtown and his family.
And it is especially to those ofyou
who come from so far
that I must apologize from the bottom ofmy heart...
because, unfortunately
Samuel cannot be here this afternoon.
I know how very deeply disappointed
each and every one of you must be feeling right now
but I say unto you, do not be dismayed.
Do not despair!
Do not lose your hope...
because in two short days, Samuel will be back here
at our very special miracle mission!
Yes, indeed, praise God.
Maybe we should head backstage
and see what the reverend has to say.
Wait. This is where they bring out Elvis.
As these people will testify
Samuel can heal you.
Yes, Samuel will heal you.
But...
only if you believe.
God bless you!
Scully: Reverend Hartley, we're with the FBl.
I see Sheriff Daniels has sent in the cavalry.
We just want to talk to Samuel
for a couple of minutes.
He's not here.
Mulder: Well, where is he?
I don't know.
I haven't seen him.
That boy's been a bit troubled lately.
We're running late, Reverend.
If you'll excuse me.
Agent Mulder?
Yeah.
Sheriff Daniels.
We spoke on the phone.
This is Special Agent Dana Scully.
You requested a copy of the coroner's report.
Right. Thankyou.
I see you got a chance
to take in the Holy Roller sideshow.
Something tells me you're not a member
of the reverend's fock.
I remember Hartley
when he was a soapbox preacher
collecting dollar bills in coffee cans.
Since the boyjoined the act
he's gotten himselfa Cadillac for every day of the week
bought forwith money
that should be used to improve our roads and schools.
People want to believe.
99% of the people in this world are fools
and the rest ofus are in great danger of contagion.
Even if Hartley and Samuel are fakes
it's still a long way
from accusing the boy of murder.
Witnesses say the boy was there
laying hands on those people when they died.
You think that's how he killed them, with a touch?
I don't know how
but we've been looking for him since Tuesday
and he does not want to be found.
There's nothing unusual about these reports
except that there were no autopsies.
Hartley blocked my autopsy request
on religious grounds.
It doesn't help that the county coroner
is a member of the Miracle Ministry.
Maybe we can arrange
to have them exhumed.
to have them exhumed.
Sheriff...
It's Reverend Hartley's group.
Damn.
I told my people to keep quiet so this wouldn't happen.
Looks like you might have a few believers
on the payroll.
Man: On behalf of the Miracle Ministry
we demand that you stop this sacrilege.
You're not just dealing with me anymore, Vance.
You're dealing with the FBl.
We don't mean you any disrespect.
We're investigating a possible homicide.
Federal law requires we do a postmortem examination on these bodies.
I'm afraid we answer to a higher authority
than the U.S. government-- one that considers grave digging
and defiling corpses mortal sins.
Daniels: We'll get that autopsy, Vance.
Sooner or later, you know we will.
The deceased's family
does not want her grave disturbed.
Carol Wallace had no family.
We were her family.
We were her family
and it was hard enough to bury her once.
So if you insist on going through with this
we're prepared to maintain a vigil
and do whatever it takes to stop you.
Daniels: Mulder
Scully...
What?
One of my men just spotted the boy's car downtown.
Can't do much here.
Mulder: Let's go.
Daniels: Not a very likely place to be saving souls.
Where's the boy, Zook?
He's in the can.
What happened here?
Damn fool started a fight.
Figures them Bible thumpers
wouldn't know how to hold their liquor.
Where you been, Samuel?
We've been looking for you.
Yeah?
I've been thinking.
Well, you're going to have plenty of time
for that now, son.
I'm putting you under arrest.
For murder?
For suspicion ofmurder.
You mind if I finish my beer first?
Well, you go right on ahead.
I'm going to have somebody take a statement from you.
I'll see what I can do
about getting your Caddie towed.
Hey, Sheriff.
What evidence do you have
to charge the boy with murder?
Well, what more do you want?
The boy's practically given himself up.
He's drunk, though.
Well, then I'll add drunk and disorderly.
Let's get this straight.
It's not a question about the boy's guilt
just how he did it.
Let me have a minute with him?
Suit yourself.
Samuel, I'm Agent Mulder.
This is Agent Scully.
We're from the FBl.
Looks like you took quite a beating there.
Penance, Mr. Mulder.
Some might call it a plain old bar brawl.
You know what they say--
" He giveth and He taketh away."
Man gets too proud
sometimes it does him good
to get the crap kicked out of him.
Saves God the trouble.
The trouble of what?
Humbling the guilty sinner.
Guilty of murder?
Yes, sir.
How did you do it, Samuel?
Apparently, my pride and my weakness
were an invitation to the devil.
I muddied the river of my own faith.
Now my gift has been corrupted.
You're saying that you killed those people with a touch?
I've laid my hands on the ill, given them health.
I've healed the sick.
I've even touched the dying and given them life.
God has given me a special gift.
Did He buy you all that jewelry too?
Something is missing in your story.
Do you doubt the power of God, ma'am?
No, but I doubt the veracity of your claims.
I have looked on the infirm and seen their sickness--
their cancer.
just as I can see the pain
on this man right here.
Really?
What pain is that?
The pain you have...
regarding a brother
or a sister.
It's an old pain.
It's never been healed.
Is this some kind
of a trick?
No trick, ma'am.
Let's get the sheriff...
I want to hear more about this pain. Tell me.
I can see it, plain as day.
It was a sister.
You lost a sister quiteyoung.
Someone took her away.
What else do you see?
Strangers...
a bright light.
Sheriff...
Samuel: You should have come here earlier.
I could have healed your pain.
Let's get this overwith.
I need another minute.
I can't help you, not anymore.
My gift is gone.
Cuff him.
Let's go.
You have the right to remain silent.
I'll tell you, Mr. Mulder--
God watches over his fock.
He gives us signs every day.
Open your heart.
He mightjust open your eyes.
How do you think
he does it?
I don't know.
Woman: Given his exemplary record
and the highly circumstantial nature ofthis case
I ask that my client be released
on his own recognizance
without bail...
judge, that is not a good idea.
Samuel!
Let me go
and it will be on your head.
Enough.
This is not a pulpit, this is a court oflaw.
Is that understood?
Yes, sir.
Sorry.
Man: Your Honor, despite the defendant's
avowed guilt
we see no reason to burden the county
with his maintenance until trial.
But we do request a minimum bail of$1 00,000.
All right, ifthere are no objections.
Bail is set at $1 00,000
to be deposited directly into the clerk's
probation account.
My God!
What is it?
Good God!
My God!
What is it?!
What is this?
What...
What...
Oh, God!
How much more
will it take foryou to believe?
The Lord has testified against me.
Does the serpent have to biteyou
on the ass till you understand?
Everybody, clear this courtroom.
Mulder: "And when it was morning
"the east wind brought the locusts.
"And the locusts covered the face ofthe whole earth.
"So that the land was darkened.
And they did eat every herb..."
Come on, Mulder...
"And all the fruit ofthe trees which the hail..."
A few thousand grasshoppers
does not constitute a plague.
Besides, we're in farm country.
This area is an agricultural smorgasbord
for this type ofinfestation.
Maybe in a cornfield, but this happened in a courtroom.
So what's next?
The slaying ofthe firstborn?
(chuckles)
Does this have to do
with what Samuel said in the bar last night
aboutyour sister?
I had these patient cases sent over
from Kenwood County Hospital.
These are physician-documented cases
ofpatients who went to Samuel
after conventional treatments failed.
"Spontaneous remission ofmetastatic cancer...
" Regenerated nerve growth after post-trauma paraplegia..."
I have encountered dozens ofpsychic healers
but none like this.
I think the kid is for real.
This is intriguing
but there is a whole library ofmedical literature
dealing with unexplained spontaneous cures.
Now Western medicine treats the human body
in biochemical terms.
But the body could also be treated
as an electromagnetic system.
Soyour theory is that ifSamuel
can repair this energy field to heal
he can also destroy it to kill.
Why not?
Okay, say that Samuel's touch can kill.
Whywould he want to?
He said he muddied the river ofhis own faith, meaning...
(knock at door)
Ifyou're available
Reverend would like to seeyou.
Hartley: I've been under a lot ofstress lately
which I know doesn't excuse my rude behavioryesterday
but I hopeyou found it in your hearts to forgive me.
Why did you want to speakwith us?
I need your help.
Samuel is being tried for murder.
You need a good lawyer.
Samuel is innocent.
How can you be sure?
Because he's my son.
That argument will not work on ajury.
And Samuel's confession won't help much either.
You have to understand--
Samuel is a very complicated young man.
He feels things like no one else.
To him, a pinprick becomes a gaping wound.
His power comes
from this ability to feel.
But some people fear that power.
And out oftheirweakness and their fear
they seek to destroy it.
You mean Sheriff Daniels.
It's no secret Sheriff Daniels has been trying to shut me down
since I first opened my tent
ten years ago.
He seems to think
thatyour ministry is a fraud.
He's a faithless man, Agent Scully.
His wife, she suffers from a most painful arthritis.
Her fingers are twisted like bitter roots.
Yet he keeps Samuel from ministering to her.
In light ofrecent events, you can't blame him.
I don't know how those poor people died.
I can't explain that.
Which is why I'm asking you to be there tonight
soyou could see foryourselves
Samuel doing God's work.
Can I count on you both to be there?
I think so. Mulder, what doyou think?
Excuse me.
Where did she go?
Who?
The little girl.
There's no little girl around here.
Scully: Mulder...
A little girl.
Brothers and sisters, helpyourselves.
Let the folks with the wheelchairs through now.
That's right. Don't be shy.
Hello there.
Welcome to the Miracle Ministry.
Y'all come to see Samuel tonight?
Yes.
Will he be here? The paper said--
Don't mind the papers.
God's workwill be done.
Young Samuel will cast out the devil
and heal the sick.
Did you hear that, honey?
Could he see me?
I'll tell you what--
I'll put in a special word, hmm?
What's your name, darling?
Margaret Hohman.
Margaret, you wait right here.
I'll see ifsomebody can putyou
in the front row.
How's that, huh?
I can't go out there, not afterwhat's happened.
God tests the faith in us all, son.
And because He has chosen you to act in His likeness
He has given you the toughest test ofall.
Do not forsake your gift, Samuel.
Aw, man.
I'm a preacher, son.
That's my gift.
But all the preaching in the world
could never equal even a small miracle
in consolidating the faith and hope
ofthese people.
Let this man-- whose lifeyou saved--
give witness tonight to the grace and goodness
ofyour healing power.
They're all waiting on you, Samuel.
Choir: *Ready, you got to be ready*
*Ready, you got to be ready*
*Ready, you got to be ready*
*Ready, you got to be ready*
*Ready, you got to be ready*
*Ready, you got to be ready*
*Ready, ready, ready*
*Ready, ready, ready*
*Ready, ready, ready*
*ReadywhenJesus comes.*
Yes, indeed!
Praise God!
Hallelujah!
All: Hallelujah!
Praise the Lord!
All: Praise the Lord!
God is here tonight.
Oh, yes.
- (crowd murmurs agreement) - Pass it down, please.
I feel His presence.
Oh, amen!
Apparently miracles don't come cheap.
God is here
and He...
is here...
to heal!
(cheering)
Yes, heal!
Hallelujah.
There's a man
I'd like to introduce toyou--
a man who has seen the face ofGod
but who was not satisfied to go to that great place.
No, God had work for him to do right here on Earth.
As it is in heaven, mm-hmm.
I saw this man come back
from beyond death's door.
He stands here today as a living testament
to the ability ofGod
to work miracles.
Ladies and gentlemen
brothers and sisters...
our beloved friend, Leonard Vance.
Leonard: As it says inJohn
chapter three--
" No man can do these miracles unless God be with him."
(murmurs ofagreement)
That man to whom I owe my life
is Samuel Hartley.
And he is here tonight to heal you.
Hartley: Thankyou, Leonard.
Ladies and gentlemen--
"God's soldier, Samuel Hartley".
(crowd clapping)
(gospel music begins)
Mulder!
(choir singing)
*lt's time to seek the Lord*
- *Find your daily time* - Receive God's love.
*For the time of His coming is near*
- *For no man knows* - Through the power ofGod.
*The day nor the hour*

*You better get your house in order*
*Or it may be too late*

*Ready, ready...*
(gasping)
(gasping louder)
(loud heaving)
What haveyou done, boy?
All right, everyone, remain calm.
Give this young woman some room.
Everybody praise God.
- Say hallelujah. - Get an ambulance!
Don't panic now! just praise the Lord!
Oh, my baby.
She's dead.
(sobbing)
My lovely friends, children ofGod
brothers and sisters
ifyou desecrate the body
then you slay the soul.
Let's keep this poorwoman's body intact.
We know that Reverend Hartley's
been pressuring you
but this is the third death linked
with the Miracle Ministry.
Reverend Hartley says
an autopsy is against Scripture.
What illness did your daughter suffer from, Mr. Hohman?
She had M.S.
Has she ever had a seizure before this?
Not to my knowledge.
You see, I think that the seizure she had
is indicative ofsome kind ofembolism or aneurysm.
But the boy only touched her forehead.
And areyou going to be content
to bury herwithout knowing the true cause ofdeath?
Without knowing ifthere was foul play involved?
Give me a moment.
You think the boy really did it?
No.
Why not?
I was raised a Catholic
and I have a certain familiarity with the Scripture
and God never lets the devil steal the show.
You must have really liked The Exorcist.
One ofmy favorite movies.
Well...
So who wereyou pursuing in the crowd tonight?
I thought I saw someone I knew.
That boy really has you going, doesn't he?
Why doyou say that?
In the bar, Samuel mentioned your sister.
Is ityour sister you thinkyou're seeing?
I've seen her twice now.
Maybeyoujust want to see her.
I'm not delusional, Scully.
Don't discount the power ofsuggestion.
A healer's greatest magic
Iies in the patient's willingness to believe.
Imagine a miracle, you're halfway there.
We learned that in med school.
You think this is what Margaret Hohman
or her parents were imagining?
We're going to go along with your investigation.
It's 1 1 :21 p.m., March 7.
Subject's name is Margaret Hohman.
Female, Caucasian
1 07 pounds.
Mulder, take a look at this.
Do I have to?
Lesions on the lungs here.
I'm finding them throughout the cardiovascular
and pulmonary systems.
There's also damage to the mucous membranes.
She must have died from cellular hypoxia.
A lack ofoxygen to the cells.
What would cause that?
My guess? lngestion or injection
ofsodium or potassium cyanide, maybe arsenic.
I won't know exactly
until I run a toxicology screen on her.
How soon?
Lab opens in the morning.
See whoyou can push to get it done-- as soon as possible.
(door clanks shut)
(footsteps)
Samuel, it's Agent Mulder.
Yeah? What doyou want?
I want to talkwith you.
Ifyou'd preferyour attorneywere present...
Whatever. No.
I put a call in to Sheriff Daniels. He's on his way down here.
- I'm going to ask him to releaseyou. - Why areyou doing this?
You were there, man.
You saw foryourself.
Did you poison Margaret Hohman?
Did I poison her?
Did you poison her using potassium or sodium cyanide?
Because that's what killed her.
What areyou talking about?
You're innocent, Samuel.
Unless you had a hand in administering it. I don't thinkyou did.
Whatever the cause, Mr. Mulder, I am responsible.
Evidence will be presented tomorrow.
Habeas corpus law will force them to releaseyou.
You should go home and get some rest.
just leave me alone, okay?
Ifyou think the punishment foryour sins
is the deaths ofthose people...
The Lord has testified against me.
I can't stand here and argue with your biblical rhetoric
but I do know that the law will find you innocent.
You said you could see my pain.
Look at me.
What doyou see now?
I see nothing.
I am blind.
I don't believeyou.
I've seen her.
It was her, wasn't it?
Your sister?
You made her appear to me, didn'tyou?
Look at me.
I am very tired, Mr. Mulder.
Is she alive?!
Is that what I'm supposed to believe
or is this a trick?
You mean...
a trick ofthe devil?
(exasperated sigh)
jailer!
I see I'm a little late for the ball.
I wanted you to release the boy.
On what pretense?
His innocence.
Aren'tyou out ofyour depth here?
This may be Hicksville toyou
but we do try and hew to the legal system.
He seems determined to stay here anyway.
What does that tell you?
It tells meyou're determined to have him charged
whileyour real homicide suspect is still at large.
(footsteps)
Got some company forya, Sam.
(grunting)
What areyou looking at?
(doorbell rings)
I'll get it.
I'll get it.
Ma'am, Sheriff.
Hey, Dennis. How areya?
just fine, ma'am,just fine.
Except we had an incident down at thejail.
What incident, Tyson?
The preacher boy.
He's dead.
He was alone in his cell when Mulder left him this morning.
How could this have happened?
The boy started a fight
with a couple ofrowdies we picked up on a D.U.I.
Took some mean blows to the head.
Died before the ambulance got here.
His blood is spilled
and it's all overyou!
Reverend...
How much longer
areyou going to hide behind that badge
before the truth is revealed?
I have work to do.
Reverend Hartley...
we're sorry foryour loss.
That boy... he was blessed.
He never hurt a soul.
Vance: Come on there, Reverend.
Our friends will find out about Samuel
sooner than later, and, well...
it's probably best ifthey hear it from you.
Come on.
Ma'am.
You got that look on your face, Mulder.
What look is that?
The kind when you've forgotten your keys
and you're trying to figure out
how to get back in the house.
What exactly are we trying to find?
Clues.
Oh.
What does it mean?
Mulder: Let's find out.
Scully.
It's potato.
Someone left a trail offood
in the ventilation system leading to the courtroom.
You dumpyour locusts in here...
instant plague.
Where do they come from?
Biological supply houses
hatch them on order to farms and universities.
Shouldn't be too hard to find out who set this up.
And you think whoever did this
is responsible for the murders.
(frightened gasp)
You're dead.
They killed you.
I was dead...
but here I am.
No!
Why did you betray me?
You murdered those people.
They came to me to be healed
and you murdered them.
Why?
After I gaveyou backyour life.
You call this life?!
(knocking)
What in tarnation doyou want?
We have a warrant
for the arrest of Leonard Vance.
Where is he?
You must be mistaken.
Scully: Afraid not, Reverend.
We traced a pesticide order to him
from a chemical company.
Cyanogen bromide--
It's a cyanide derivative.
Leonard poisoned those people?
(whimpering)
Getyour clothes on, Vance.
You're under arrest.
I betrayed him.
Cyanide.
There's no way to tell how much he's ingested.
I'll call an ambulance.
We have to get him to the hospital ourselves.
I thought, "Why didn't he let me die?"
Beware offalse prophets
who come toyou in sheep's clothing
but inwardly are ravening wolves.
That's what I thought he was
because who else would bring me back
Iooking like this?
He was here.
- Who? - Samuel.
The man's delirious.
He was here, Reverend.
Right in this room...
and he forgave me.
(choking gasp)
Scully: Rather than simply killing Samuel
Vance contrived to kill the ministry's faith in him.
We have conclusive evidence
connecting him both to the courtroom infestation
and to the poisoning deaths
ofthree members ofthe ministry.
Vance's obsession outlived Samuel however.
His conscience haunted him until he became delusory
and finally took his own life
effectively ending our investigation.
In light ofthis information
it is highly doubtful
that there have ever been any miracles
in Kenwood, Tennessee.
(phone rings)
Mulder.
(knock at door)
Scully?
Sheriff Danielsjust called.
Samuel's body is missing from the morgue.
Anywitnesses?
One, so far.
The night nurse who made the report--
Beatrice Salinger.
She saw somebody take him?
Not actually.
What doyou mean?
Talk sense, Deputy.
She didn't exactly see anyone taking the body.
Well, what then?
She, uh...
she claims she saw Samuel walking out by himself.
Sounds crazy, I know, but that's what she told me.
You coming, Sheriff?
I was drinking my coffee
and going over the night orders
for myward, seven south,
when he walked right by me.
His face was all black and blue.
You're sure it was him.
Well, at first I thought my eyes were playing tricks
which happens a lot on graveyard
so I got up to look again
but I lost him around a corner.
Hejust vanished.
Then I went to check the morgue
and his bodywas gone.
Daniels: This is insane.
I won't listen to any more ofthis crazy talk.
I'm not the only one who saw him, Sheriff
so I know I'm not crazy.
Other people saw him too.
I'm not crazy.
It was Samuel.
Lillian: This isn't true, Maurice, is it?
The boywas an awful fake
just likeyou said, wasn't he, Maurice?
Wasn't he, Maurice?
(knocking)
Sir...
going to have to askyou
to come with me.
District Attorney
wants to askyou some questions
concerning the boy's death.
Sundays will probably never be the same again
in these parts.
I have a strong sense the Reverend Hartley
is not going to be able to give up the pulpit.
Even without his son?
Might even strengthen his faith.
The boy did rise from the dead.
That kind ofthing happens only once or twice
every 2,000 years or so.
Yeah, and I have a story about a plague oflocusts.
I just hope Reverend Hartley
didn't arrange his body snatching
as his miracle ofmiracles.
Somehow, I don't think so.
What exactly doyou think?
I think people are looking hard for miracles.
So hard that maybe they make themselves see
what theywant to see.
You coming, Mulder?
I made this.

ï»¿1 Mm-hmm, yes.
Love you.
I love you.
Hello.
Morning, sir.
Ah, good morning.
Good morning, Cecil.
Top of the morning to you.
Oh, thank you.
Good-bye, darling.
Good-bye, Charles.
What time can I expect you?
Before supper.
I forgot what it was like to spend a day in court.
That's one of the luxuries
to hunting down aliens and genetic mutants.
You rarely get to press charges.
It's opened.
What?
It's unlocked.
That's weird.
I'm sure I locked it.
Must be an X file.
What's that?
I told you I locked the door.
What do you think it is?
Ten to one, you can't dance to it.
Greetings, Agent Mulder.
Six months ago, British Minister of Parliament
Reggie Ellicott received an audio cassette
much like the one you are listening to now.
Unfortunately for Minister Ellicott,
when he popped the tape into the car stereo,
he armed a device which, when he tried to exit the car,
created an explosion which was heard five miles away.
The Scotland Yard forensic team could only identify
the poor bastard by his dental records.
If only he hadn't reached for the door handle
and triggered the detonator.
But then how was he to know
he was sitting on enough plastic explosive
to lift the car 40 feet in the air
and deposit the engine block
on top of a three-story building?
Aren't we looking rather ghostly?
It's an old friend.
Aren't you going to thank me?
For what?
Saving your life.
One tends not to make the same mistake twice.
I'll try to remember that. Oh, come on,
don't tell me you left your sense of humor
in Oxford ten years ago.
No, actually it's one of the few things
you didn't drive a stake through.
You know, some mistakes are quite worth making twice.
Dana Scully,
this is Phoebe Greene.
Terror of Scotland Yard.
Hello.
Hello.
She hates me.
What brings you to the colonies?
Some clever bloke has been giving
the aristocracy a good scare.
Killed off a ranking member of Parliament
or three for good measure.
Set Windsor Castle ablaze in '92.
Your car bomber?
No. This one likes
to burn his victims alive.
Can't figure out how he does it either.
Not a crumb of evidence left at the crime scene.
The last one died in his front garden,
his poor, young wife watching helplessly
as he went up in smoke.
The Irish Republican Army?
Our suspect likes to send love letters
to his victims' wives.
Sent one to the wife of Sir Malcolm Marsden
a month ago.
Three days later he narrowly escaped a fire in his garage.
It burned to the ground.
So they're renting a place out on Cape Cod.
Bringing the family over to the States
for an extended holiday
or until we can catch the dirty bugger.
Do you think he's that determined?
Judging by his success, he seems to take
a certain delight in his work.
So, what brings you on this detour to Washington, D.C.,
Inspector?
I figured my friend Mulder...
...couldn't resist a three-pipe problem.
I'll run it by our arson specialist.
Splendid.
I'll call London, let them know.
Oh, good-bye.
Three-pipe problem?
That's from, uh,
Sherlock Holmes.
It's a private joke.
How private?
Um...
we knew each other in school in England.
She was brilliant
and, uh, I got in over my head
and, uh, paid the price.
Mulder, you just keep unfolding like a flower.
That was over ten years ago, Scully.
Yeah, I noticed how you couldn't drop everything
fast enough in order to help her out.
Oh, I was merely extending her a professional courtesy.
Oh, is that what you were extending?
Look, I'm going to run this by the arson guys
and then she's on her own.
Something tells me you're not going
to get rid of her that easily.
Beautiful.
Oh, just beautiful.
Look at that.
Salmon red flames.
This is 1,400-1,500 degrees.
This is a work of art.
Was there any kind of incendiary device used?
Yes, actually.
The victim's body.
Spontaneous combustion?
He was murdered.
However, we've turned up no evidence
that tells how the body caught fire.
That's peculiar.
People don't normally just catch on fire.
I mean, we burn, but we don't conduct all that well.
There's usually some kind of extraneous fuel involved
like candle wax, gasoline--
something flammable and incendiary
that adheres to the skin.
Like an accelerant.
Like an accelerant. Yes. But we've found no trace
of anything save for a dusting of magnesium
at two of the sites.
That's aliphatic pyrolysis.
It's a residue remaining after an exothermic reaction.
But there's no evidence of the source--
no pour pattern or ignition devices.
There have been some arson fires
in Seattle lately and, um, Pennsylvania.
They burn so hot that the firemen can't put 'em out.
7,000 degrees.
I mean, hosing that down just makes it worse.
How's that?
Well, the, uh, reaction is so intense
that it splits the water
into hydrogen and oxygen.
It just adds fuel to the fire.
What were they using?
We don't know for sure.
It could be rocket fuel.
That stuff burns so hot and clean,
there's never a trace left.
You see, it's very difficult to prove arson.
It's driving the insurance companies nuts.
Well, that's about the only explanation that I can give you.
But there have been cases of pyrokinetics--
people who can control and conduct fire.
Well, I've seen fire bend around corners,
seen it bounce like a rubber ball.
Fire has got a certain genius, you know,
a certain demon poetry.
It's like it's got a mind of its own,
but I've never seen one that can defy
the laws of physics, not when you figure it out.
You've, uh...
got quite a case for yourself here, Mulder.
I almost wish I could be in your shoes.
Hey, Jackson.
Boy, that's a nice house.
Oh, what do you think? What a pleasant surprise.
Welcome to America, Sir Malcolm.
Thank you very much. I'm delighted to be here.
Where's the dog?
Darling.
Right there.
In here, please. Thank you.
And over there as well. All right.
But the second one, I want upstairs.
Gentlemen, the second set of boxes
will go directly up the stairs.
Please be careful.
Hello there.
Hello.
I'm Bob the caretaker.
We've been exchanging letters.
Oh, good heavens. Yes, of course.
Hello, Bob, how are you? Excuse the paint.
Hi. Hello.
Just trying to spruce the place up for you.
Well, it's delightful.
The photos don't do it justice.
Anything I can do for you, anything at all,
you just holler.
Seems like a rather nice fellow, don't you think?
Very.
My God, darling,
that painting rather looks like you.
What do you think?
Oh, I don't know.
I've never been good at this one.
Bloody little cur, I'll skin you alive.
See, I'm the caretaker now.
So, Sherlock, is the game afoot?
I'm afraid so, Watson.
You're off the hook on this one.
What do you mean?
I mean I'm not going to put you through this.
Put me through what?
Phoebe's little mind game.
What are you talking about?
There's something else I haven't told you about myself, Scully.
I hate fire.
Hate it.
I'm scared to death of it.
When I was a kid, my best friend's house burned down.
Had to spend the night in the rubble to keep away looters.
For years I had nightmares
about being trapped in a burning building.
Wait,
and Phoebe knows about this? Oh, yeah,
this is classic Phoebe Greene, mind game player extraordinaire.
Ten years it's taken me to forget about this woman,
and she shows up in my life with a case like this.
So she shows up knowing the power she has over you
and then she makes you walk through fire.
Is that it?
Phoebe is fire.
Mulder, are you sure
you don't want me to help you out on this one?
Sooner or later, a man's got to face his demons.
Hello, you're the Marsdens' driver?
Who's that?
Bob.
Caretaker.
Oh.
Bum a smoke?
Yeah, sure.
I'm going into town.
Can I get you anything?
Yeah... some cough medicine if it's no problem.
Syrup or...
lozenges?
Syrup would be good.
Can I give you some money?
Appreciate that.
Beer.
They don't let you bring your own around here.
Well, I guess they'll just have to make an exception,
won't they?
Oh, you're English.
God, I just love that accent.
Allow me.
And a gentleman to boot.
Oh, my God.
Now, that is a trick.
Hey, guys, take a look at this.
Care for a light?
I pulled this report off the wire last night.
Eyewitnesses are saying
that a customer in the bar caught fire,
but they're still looking for a body.
Any indication an accelerant was used?
The bar is across the street from a fire station.
Burned to the ground
before they had a chance to even respond.
The fire marshal said it burned so hot,
it turned the concrete foundation into sponge cake.
This is a woman who was in the bar.
Hello. Hello.
Miss Kotchik? Yes.
I'm Special Agent Mulder from the FBI.
This is Inspector Greene.
Can you tell us
what happened in the bar last night?
There was this guy.
I'd had a few drinks, so...
He sat next to me and he did this thing.
It was like a magic trick
where he lit his finger on fire.
Next thing, I turned around, he was up in flames.
Can you describe him?
Good-looking, I think.
Brownish hair.
Long hair, short hair?
I've already given the police the information.
Do you think you could work with a composite artist
and come up with a sketch for us?
Look, I said I had a few drinks.
Can I get your full name and address?
See...
I live with someone.
He thinks I was at school last night.
It's no problem.
You can come down
to the field office and work with somebody there.
I'll give you a minute to think about it, okay?
Deftly done, Agent Mulder.
Casually disregard her indiscretion.
A firm but polite manner
until she accedes to cooperate.
It's a technique I refined in my relationship with you.
Oh, yes, well,
I see you haven't lost your sense of humor after all.
I'm sorry, that was a cheap shot.
I don't want to dredge up the past.
Let's just stick to the case.
Let's.
Look, Phoebe, I... Unless I'm mistaken,
ten years seems sufficient time to have forgiven
if not forgotten a few youthful indiscretions.
I'm cursed with a photographic memory.
Then don't you tell me that you've forgotten
a certain youthful indiscretion...
atop Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's tombstone
on a misty night in Windlesham.
Like I said, let's just stick to the case.
Well, it occurred to me that we're going to a lot of trouble
to find the description of a man who, in all likelihood,
has been burned to a crisp.
I would agree with you, but they haven't found a body yet.
So, can we count on you?
Yeah, okay.
I don't know if it matters,
but I remembered something else about the guy who caught fire.
He had an English accent.
Having a rough time, huh?
Maybe it's the cough syrup.
After reviewing the files
of the Scotland Yard arson/murders,
two points remain unexplained.
One is the use of an untraceable accelerant.
The other involves the victims.
Since they all burned in the presence of family members
in safe surroundings, this indicates
unusually intimate access to the victims by the arsonist.
The arsonist is most likely a male less than 25 years of age.
He will often act out of impulse,
satisfying sexual urges or insecurities
with destructive behavior, which compensates
for his social inadequacies or maladjustments.
You boys want to see a magic trick?
Okay.
What's your names?
Michael and Jimmie.
Doesn't he talk?
Yes.
What kind of a magic trick?
Maybe I'd better not.
Show us.
Nah, you might tell your mom and dad.
We won't tell.
Really? Promise?
Promise.
Hope to die-- stick a needle in your eye?
Okay, boys.
You've taken the solemn oath of trust that can't be broken
except under penalty...
of death.
Watch.
Is it in there?
No.
Ah, you're too smart for me.
Where did it go?
Where did it go?
Where do you think it went, Jimmie?
I don't know.
Uh... I think I remember.
Ta-da!
Ooh!
Yes.
Okay, we'll do it again.
Agent Beatty? Yeah.
I'm Special Agent Dana Scully.
Can I steal a minute of your time?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, come in,
come in, come in.
I'm just working on this Mafia torch job here.
I'm working with Agent Mulder.
Oh, yeah, wild case.
So, what can I do for you?
You mentioned that the arsonist might be using
some kind of rocket fuel as an accelerant.
Yeah, that's just speculation.
It still doesn't explain how he sets bodies on fire.
What if he got some of this fuel
into some hand cream or...?
Well, you've got to understand,
even the smallest amounts of this stuff
can produce temperatures over 5,000 degrees,
but I suppose it's not impossible.
Extremely diluted.
But you still have to find a way to ignite it.
Wow! It lit by itself!
Come on, sit down.
So, you guys ever smoked a cigarette?
No. They're bad for you.
Would you like to take a puff, Michael?
No.
Make a man out of you.
I don't want to.
Why don't you hold one for me?
How about you, Jimmie?
Huh, little man?
Jimmie,
Michael.
Hello.
Bob.
Ugh.
There you are.
Um, we've had
a bit of bad news.
Um, our driver has taken ill,
and we're due at a party in Boston this evening.
Is there any chance that we can impose upon you
to drive the family into town?
We'd be more than happy to pay you for your time
and certainly to put you up for the night.
I'd be very happy to do it as a favor.
Oh, good, thank you.
All right, then, boys, let's go.
Daddy's got lunch all ready.
Jimmie, you're absolutely filthy.
Come on, I'll race you.
Oh, Mom, I don't mind. Honestly, Jimmie...
The arsonist is usually unmarried
and prone to obsessive fantasies about women or men
who are inaccessible to him.
Often the setting of fires results from his cowardice
and inability to develop a natural relationship.
His crimes are often very clever and elaborately planned.
The suspicious nature of the fire last night
strongly suggests the arsonist has followed Lord Marsden
to the United States.
A check of all recent immigration
to the northeastern area is underway.
It has become not a matter of if
but when he will strike.
Here's that immigration data you wanted.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Remember those reports I told you about-- about people
who control and conduct fire-- pyrokinetics?
Vaguely.
I think this guy just sent us a message
that he's far more exotic.
I should say so, I mean, if he can set himself afire.
What?
I'm just not used to someone so quick to agree with me.
The driver's a very capable bodyguard.
Well, he should look into getting a few additional men
and limit public exposure.
Oh, they've got a party being held
in their honor tonight in Boston.
They're gonna have to cancel.
Unless you wanted to set a trap.
I had thought of that,
but we must be careful and discreet.
The party's at 8:00 at the Venable Plaza.
I'll be traveling with the family
so why don't you go on ahead and have
a look around? Oh, and...
I've taken a room at the hotel for the night.
Thanks.
All right, thank you.
Mulder.
It's Scully. Where are you?
I'm in Boston.
I've got something to show you.
I'm gonna come up there.
What have you got?
I might have some information
on the identity of your arson suspect.
Are you there, Mulder?
Yeah... yeah.
Can I meet you somewhere?
No, it's just, I'm, I'm kind of anticipating
having my hands full.
We're here.
Good evening. Thank you.
Let's go inside.
Evening, sir. Hello.
Enjoying yourself?
There's good food,
witty conversation.
I'm having the time of my life.
I wondered if you think it's safe enough
to indulge ourselves in a dance?
Doesn't look like your arsonist
is going to make an appearance.
That doesn't mean there won't be any fires to put out.
I've thought about you often.
There's a fire upstairs.
What?
On the 14th floor.
That's where the children are.
We've got a fire on the 14th floor.
Let us out!
Hurry up.
Here we go. Got one down.
Come on, buddy, come on.
Come on, here you go.
Can you walk? You get him?
Yeah, I got him. Hold on.
Here we are.
Mommy.
Jimmie, Michael, oh, my God, are you all right?
You saved their lives.
Who is he? He's the driver.
Thanks. Thanks.
Well done, good job, thank you.
You were really out.
Where's Phoebe?
She's down the hall.
What about the kids?
Okay. The doctor checked them out.
What happened to you up there?
I panicked.
Couldn't even move, Scully.
It could have happened to anyone.
Yeah... but it happened to me.
I haired out... plain and simple.
What do you know about
this guy that saved the kids-- the driver?
I checked him out prior to the Marsdens' arrival.
He's worked on the property for eight years.
No record.
His references checked out.
They were lucky he was here tonight.
Who was watching the kids tonight?
He was. Are you sure?
I could have sworn I saw him down in the hallway
about the same time that the fire broke out.
You couldn't have.
Anyway, the man we're looking for
is English. Hey.
I came to see if you were okay.
How are the kids?
They're fine.
Everybody's anxious to get back.
To the cape? Only to pack.
They've made travel arrangements
back to England for the day after tomorrow.
And you?
I'll be leaving in a few days.
Look, I'll give you a ring back at the Bureau
before I leave.
All right.
Good-bye.
You okay?
Yeah.
You at all interested in what I came
all the way up here to show you?
Yeah.
Well, I did some checking on my own.
I didn't know a whole lot about arson or arsonists
so I took the opportunity
for my own edification, of course.
I ran a profile of possible incendiary fuels
and accelerants that could have been used
in the crimes.
I also took the liberty
of running a search through Interpol
of all the gardeners,
manservants, and domestic help
that were hired by the murder victims
at the time of their deaths.
And...? And
these people probably don't even tie their own shoes.
There were over 200 names
and not a duplicate... except one.
A Cecil Lively.
He worked as a gardener for two of the victims.
And what did you find on him?
Nothing.
So he's clean. Apparently
he was questioned by Scotland Yard
and they released him, but I dug a little further.
Cecil Lively is a documented citizen
of Great Britain, paid his taxes,
never been on the dole, a model citizen--
until he died in 1971 in a London tenement fire.
I know, that's what I thought,
so I checked a little further.
Cecil L'ively, spelled "L-apostrophe," came up again.
In fact, it came up twice--
first on a list of death certificates
listed among a group of children who died in ritual sacrifice
by a satanic cult in 1963
in the Tottingham Woods outside Bath, England.
Where else did you find it?
You're going to love this.
On a list of recent visas
issued by the British government.
Cecil Lively's passport
was stamped by U.S. immigration officials
two weeks ago at the port of entry in Boston.
Call the local field office in Boston of the FBI
and get them to fax you the composite the witness did
of the man who burned down the bar and then get them
to fax it to every local law enforcement agency in the area.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to try and catch Phoebe.
This guy could be waiting for them in Cape Cod.
Yes, this is Special Agent Scully.
I've been waiting on hold for you guys
to fax me a composite of an arson suspect.
Right. Hang on a second.
It's coming through.
Thanks.
Oh, my God.
It's the driver.
We're sorry, the cellular customer you are trying to reach
is out of the area.
Excuse me.
His name is Cecil Lively.
Who?
Your arsonist.
Where's the rest of the family?
They went outside for a walk.
Well, go find 'em. We got to get 'em packed
and get 'em out of here.
Come on, we have to hurry, let's go.
I'm sorry, children, we have to leave right away.
It's the driver.
I know. He disappeared.
What's the matter?
Nothing. Um, I found this out in the garage.
It's been very hard on the family.
Did you get the composite?
He's worked for us for over ten years.
Well, obviously there's been some type of mistake.
Oh.
Oh, my God.
This isn't the driver.
It's the caretaker.
And he's upstairs with the children.
Jimmie, Michael... Michael.
Michael?
Michael.
Jimmie.
Looks like we found
the missing driver.
Mulder, in here quickly.
What's going on?
They just went up
all by themselves.
My God!
Oh, my God. Everybody out!
Let's go, get out, get out!
Let's go! Go, go, go!
I think he rigged the whole house.
Oh, no.
It's fuel.
Go! Go!
Quick, come on. Come on.
Come on, move, move.
Scully, see if you can find a fire extinguisher.
Everybody else, outside.
But what about the children?
I'll take care of the children.
Go.
You gonna be okay, Mulder?
Oh, yeah, I'll be fine.
There's no place I'd rather be.
Michael, Jimmie, you in there?
Time to call 911.
Don't move!
Freeze.
Federal agent.
You won't shoot me.
Stay right where you are.
You see?
'Cause you don't know
the spark from that round
won't blow this whole house to kingdom come.
Aah!
Back off, Scully, it's the accelerant!
No.
Help us! Help us!
Help us, please! Help!
Michael, Jimmie, thank God, thank God.
You can't kill me!
You can't fight fire
with fire!
Care to take me to lunch?
Scare you?
You have no idea.
Where is Phoebe?
I don't know.
You don't know.
She didn't call?
No. She did messenger this to me last night, though.
Did you play it?
No.
Why not?
Aren't you curious what's on it?
Ten to one, you can't dance to it.
X file #11214893:
addendum to the file opened by Special Agent Mulder.
The arson suspect Cecil Lively
was admitted to Boston Mercy Hospital
with fifth- and sixth-degree burns
over his entire body.
Military burn specialists have been brought in
to study the case, which they're calling extraordinary
not only for the fact the suspect survived
but for the rapid regeneration of his basal cell tissue.
Full recovery is anticipated in as little as a month.
Lively is being held
in a high-security medical facility.
until he can be tried on murder charges
in the death of a Massachusetts caretaker.
His body temperature remains at a steady 109 degrees.
Health technicians have removed
anything flammable from his room
due to several fires
which have broken out in the vicinity.
According to Agent Mulder,
further incarceration remains a problem
for federal penal authorities.
Can I get you anything, sir?
I'm just dying for a cigarette.

(screaming)
God... what areyou doing to Barnett?
- Excuse me? - What areyou doing toJohnny?
Go back toyourward.
There's nothing you can do foryour friend now.
What?
john Barnett's dead.
No, I heard him screaming.
I saidJohn Barnett is dead.
You understand?
Go on, Crandall. Get outta here.
There's nothing more to see here. You understand?
What does this have to do with us?
Robbing ajewelry store is a federal crime.
Thankyou.
I got a call from some guy I used to workwith
in the Violent Crime section.
Said it was important.
(chanting:) Reggie, Reggie.
Mulder. God, I hate it when you do that.
This is Special Agent Scully.
Reggie Purdue.
How areyou?
What happened here?
Lone gunman took out a salesgirl
after she filled up a bag for him.
You guys turn up anything?
Not much...
except...
this.
It's going to blowyour mind.
Why?
I'm telling you, Mulder
this is going to blowyour mind.
What is it?
Wait a second.
You see why I called you?
What about witness descriptions?
White male, 5'1 1 " to 6', ski mask.
Damn it, Reggie. That's Barnett.
But it can't be.
Who's Barnett?
Mulder: It was my first case at the bureau.
Barnett was doing armedjobs all over D.C.
Very trigger happy.
Killed seven people.
There was this big task force.
Reggie was myASAC.
I was 28, right out ofthe academy.
I had this theory on the case.
Reggie thought I was full ofit.
What was the theory?
That Barnett had an inside connection.
An employee at the armored car company
was tipping him off about large shipments ofcash.
I was sort ofright.
Sort of?
We planted bogus waybills
manifests with the armored car company to set a trap
but Barnett was way ahead ofus.
That's when the notes started.
" Fox can't guard the chicken coop."
Clever, huh?
So, you never caught him?
No, we did.
We did, but not, uh, not clean.
An agent died because I screwed up.
And what happened to Barnett?
He avoided the death penalty
but he went down for everyjob he did.
Consecutive terms-- 340 years.
Thejudge promised me he would die in prison.
Soyou think he escaped?
No, that'sjust it.
He did die in prison, fouryears ago.
You're sure?
I was paying attention.
Woman: This guy a friend ofyours?
Mulder: Yeah. I play golfwith him every Sunday.
What doyou think?
Youjust brought this in ten minutes ago.
You're slipping, Henderson.
Ten minutes may be enough time foryou, Mulder.
Ofcourse, I wouldn't know that
from personal experience.
Seriously, what doyou think?
Okay, first impressions--
The ink is fresh,
the note was written in the last 48 hours.
Ballpoint, butyou knew that.
A right-hander.
Let's see...
written by someone sitting down.
But now I'm just showing off.
Yeah, does it match Barnett?
I'd say it's him.
Butyou're not sure?
95%.
The writing's sloppy.
Some ofthe ascenders and descenders are heavier.
Could it have been traced over a note of Barnett's?
Could be, but it's a damn goodjob ifit is.
Thanks, Henderson. I oweyou one.
Promises, promises.
Purdue: There's Barnett.
We'd staked out an airport warehouse
but everything went to hell
when Barnett took the driver ofthe armored truck hostage.
Where's Mulder?
There, coming around back.
Barnett doesn't see him.
He's got a clear shot.
Yeah, he should have taken it.
But he couldn't.
No, not with a hostage so close.
Because it's not by the book.
It would have saved one life, maybe two.
Bastard Barnett just started blasting away.
Mulder did shoot Barnett.
Twice, in the shoulder and hand
but not before Barnett killed the driver
and Agent Steve Wallenberg.
Mulder never forgave himself for that.
You should have heard his testimony
at Barnett's trial.
Probably had a lot to do with Barnett's sentence.
I'll never forget Mulder
coming down from the witness stand
and Barnett turning and saying he'd get Mulder.
To tell you the truth
I wish Mulder had killed Barnett right there in the warehouse.
What did Henderson come up with?
95% sure it's Barnett's handwriting.
What's that?
Federal Bureau of Prisons
sent me a copy ofhis death certificate.
" Name ofdeceased: Barnett,John lrvin.
Cause ofdeath: cardiac arrest.
Date: September 1 6, 1 989."
It must be a clever copycat.
The note was written in the last 48 hours.
Pull any prints?
No prints.
Barnett had a lot oftime on his hands.
Maybe he planned it with someone on the outside.
Revenge from the grave? That would be a neat trick.
He planned to getyou, didn't he?
I wasjust down talking to Agent Purdue.
And he showed you the videotape?
You did the right thing, Mulder.
Did l? Steve Wallenberg had a wife and two kids.
One ofhis boys is an all-star on his football team now.
I pulled that trigger two seconds earlier
and Wallenberg would be here to see his kid play.
Instead, I've got some dead man
robbingjewelry stores and sending me haikus.
Down... set... hup!
Let's go! Let's go now!
Fire it in there!
Yeah, that's better!
All right! Bring it back here!
Let's go!
Hustle it up! Line it up! Let's go!
Down!
Set! Hup!
Go! Go! Go! Go hard!
(applause)
I'll getyou, you son ofa bitch!
Purdue: I've been thinking about it, Mulder, and I think...
that somebody is messing with your head.
Barnett said he'd get me. You were there.
He's dead, Mulder.
Apparently not.
Let me tell you something.
There are a lot ofguys who know Barnett made the threat.
It's Barnett, Reggie.
How can you say that?
I just feel it.
All this talk about spooky Mulder--
I never used to pay it much mind.
I figured it wasjust talk about how paranoid you were.
And now?
Remember the day you walked into my office
wet from Quantico?
You pissed me off just looking atyou
but then I saw howyour mind worked.
Howyou were always threejumps ahead.
It was scary, Mulder.
Everybody said so.
I've heard this story.
Well, maybeyou ought to hear it again.
You let a lot ofpeople down here in the bureau.
They had big plans foryou.
A lot ofpeople are saying
that spooky Mulder has become an embarrassment
a liability.
Areyou saying somebody from the bureau's behind this?
Maybe, maybe not.
It's always best to coveryour ass in any event.
Sorry.
This wasjust faxed.
It's a copy ofJohn Barnett's last will and testament.
No surviving relatives.
Left what little he had to another prisoner--
aJoe Crandall-- and instructions
for his body to be cremated.
His will was executed six months after his death.
This document states that his ashes were spread
along the bank ofthe Delaware River
by an employee ofthe crematory
used by the prison.
It's like I said. Somebody's messing with your head.
Killing a salesclerk just to leave me a note?
I'd say that's going a little out ofyourway.
Mulder: He's older now.
He may have put on some weight.
Woman: How much older?
Fiveyears.
He could be wearing any kind ofdisguise.
Woman: Take us back to the day in question.
Was ityour impression, Agent Mulder, thatJohn Barnett
took a kind ofa perverse pleasure in his crimes?
Didn't he send you notes to tauntyou?
Yes. I felt
that he was daring us to catch him.
That he killed his victims
almost as ifit were part ofa game.
Describe for the court, ifyou would, Agent Mulder
what happened when you finally caughtJohn Barnett.
We had a customs warehouse at the airport staked out.
We knew that Barnett had someone
working for the armored car transport
tipping him off about large cash shipments
but we never figured that he would actually be
inside the vehicle when it arrived.
That's how Barnett was able
to take the driver ofthe vehicle hostage.
In otherwords,John Barnett used his own accomplice
as a hostage?
Yes, ma'am.
And then what happened?
We surrounded Barnett.
We ordered him to surrender his hostage
and his weapon.
And where wereyou at this time, Agent Mulder?
I was right behind Barnett.
With a clear shot at the suspect?
Yes, ma'am.
Butyou didn't fire. Why?
It's against F.B.I. regulations
to unnecessarily endanger the life ofa hostage
and I thought
that with no means ofescape
Barnett would give up.
But what happened instead?
The suspect,John Barnett
fired his weapon point-blank at his hostage
and then he turned his gun on Steve Wallenberg...
shot him in the face.
Thankyou, Agent Mulder.
No further questions at this time.
He gunned him down just for spite.
judge: The witness will step down.
and you shot him...
...without hesitation
without conscience, without an ounce ofhumanity
which is whyyou should die like an animal
you son ofa bitch!
judge: I will find you in contempt!
- (people murmuring) - Order in the court.
Ifthere is not order in this court
I will be forced to clear the courtroom.
judge: Duly noted.
Thejurywill disregard the witness's last statement.
(whispers:) I'll... get... you.
I'll need printouts ofeveryvariation.
Right.
Right.
I just got offthe phone with the prison.
What did they come up with?
I called them on a hunch.
Barnett died ofa heart attack.
At least that's what it says on his death certificate.
I had them fax me all ofhis medical records.
Barnett was admitted to the prison infirmary
for an infection in his right hand.
There isn't any indication ofcoronary complications.
In fact, on his physical six months earlier
he was given a clean bill ofhealth.
Crandall
someone to seeyou.
I don't get manyvisitors.
You knewJohn Barnett?
Yes, sir.
How well did you know him?
Prettywell.
He leftyou everything he had in his will.
You must have known him better than prettywell.
Used to change his bandages, and wejust got to...
know each other.
Areyou aware that Barnett died ofcardiac arrest
in this facility in 1 989?
Cardiac arrest? Where does it say that?
On his death certificate.
He ain't dead, is he?
Why doyou say that?
Last time I sawJohn Barnett, it was right in that room
over there.
Doctor took his bad hand clean off.
What doctor?
Was it Dr. Ridley?
Yeah, it was Dr. Ridley.
That's the one.
He told meJohnnywas dead
but, uh, I knew it was a lie.
Put a knife right up under my chinjust for asking.
How could you tell Barnett wasn't dead?
I saw him looking at me.
I saw him blink.
I'll never forget those eyes.
What areyou going to do?
I know what I'm not going to do.
I'm not going to hang around and wait for Barnett
to send me anothervalentine.
You mean the ghost ofJohn Barnett.
I didn't knowyou believed in ghosts, Scully.
(phone ringing)
Hello?
Yeah,just a minute.
It's foryou.
Mulder.
Fox Mulder.
Barnett?
I'll run a trace.
You sound surprised.
Well, you know, shouldn't I be?
You know, it's illegal to tape another's phone call
without their express permission.
Isn't that what they call it?
In some states.
What makes you think I'm taping you?
Same thing makes me think
you're putting a trace on this call.
What state areyou in?
The same stateyou are.
I stood next toyou in line for coffee this morning.
I don't think so.
Man, I'm everywhereyou are.
Everywhere.
I own you.
How do I know it's reallyyou?
What did I say toyou in the courtroom?
Did you ever doubt me?
What did you tell me in the courtroom?
Ifyou thinkyou're going to keep me on this phone
with this clumsy act...
By all accounts, john Barnett is a dead man.
Oh, you're the dead man, Mulder.
Fine. I just need confirmation
thatyou are whoyou sayyou are.
You want confirmation?
You got it.
(kisses)
Barnett? You there?
You lost him.
Yeah, he was hip to the trace.
Was it Barnett?
john Barnett was from New Hampshire.
He had a slight accent. Listen to this.
Fine. I just need confirmation
thatyou are whoyou sayyou are.
You want confirmation?
You got it.
(kisses)
What did he mean by that?
I don't know, but that isJohn Barnett.
I'm sure ofit.
(phone ringing)
Oh...
Yeah.
Reggie, it's Mulder.
Mulder, what doyou want?
It's the middle ofthe night.
It's only 1 0:45, Reggie.
Yeah, well, I was sleeping.
Listen, Reggie, it doesn't look like Barnett's dead after all.
Now what?
I got an inmate at the prison
who swears he saw Barnett alive the night they say he died.
Mulder, go home.
Get some rest.
There'sjust one thing that doesn't make sense.
What's that?
Agent Henderson said that note left at thejewelry store
was written by a right-hander.
Yeah, so?
Well, this inmate at the prison
he swears he saw Barnett's right hand amputated.
(gurgling)
Reggie, you there?
Hey, Reggie.
Reggie? What's going on?
Areyou there?
What the hell's going on?
Reggie, what happened?
Hey, Reggie!
Reggie? What's going on? Areyou there?
What the hell's going on, Reggie?
Hopeyou guys brought your fine-tooth comb.
I want every piece oflint collected and analyzed.
Ifnothing turns up, run it through again.
Mulder...
His wife died ofcancer sixyears ago.
Never liked to talk about it.
He was working on a mystery novel.
He promised to show it to me once, but he never did.
I think he was afraid I wouldn't like it.
I'm probably the only guy on the bureau
he trusted enough to even ask.
I'm sorry.
I'm just thinking how different things would have been
ifl would have taken that shot when I had it.
We're still not 1 00% sure that this is him.
Fresh ink, slightly smeared.
I hate to tell you
and I'm not known to be wrong about these things
but this note was most certainlywritten
by a right-handed person.
You see the pressure points inside the pen grooves?
It's a dead giveaway.
Would you be able to tell ifthis note was written
by somebody using a prosthetic hand?
Well, this fellow...
and I'm assuming from the cursive figures here
that it is a male suspect--
He has a fairly nice, fuid style.
judging from the pressure variations
in the connectors
this person would need good finger dexterity.
You're not going to get that with a prosthesis.
Soyou think it's the same person that wrote the first note.
Uh-huh.
This the guyyou think killed Agent Purdue?
Yeah.
You know what occurred to me?
You never got any prints offthose notes.
Ifthis guywas wearing a glove on his pen hand
the note wouldn't be smeared like it is.
Forwhat it's worth.
I wasjust trying to find you.
Listen to this. According to the A.M.A., Dr. Ridley--
who signed Barnett's death certificate--
hasn't officially been a doctor since 1 979.
What doyou mean?
His membership expired and wasn't renewed
after Maryland revoked his medical license
for research malpractice and misuse ofa government grant.
Where does it say that?
In the federal journal
for the National lnstitute of Health.
What kind ofresearch?
He was conducting experiments on young children
afficted with a disease called progeria.
Man: The patientyou see is an eight-year-old girl
suffering from the advanced stages ofprogeria.
She looks about 90.
Only about 1 00 cases have ever been reported
so the disease is rare.
But fatal.
Some progeria patients make it to early adulthood
but others become terminal at age seven or eight.
What's the cause ofdeath?
Clinically, it's cardiac
or cerebral vascular disease
but actually
these poor kids die ofold age.
Is that Dr. Ridley?
Yes, in 1 974.
joe Ridley thought
that he could take their accelerated aging
and slow it down.
Initially
some ofhis lab work was promising
but then things got out ofcontrol.
He wanted to begin human trials.
Whywasn't he allowed to?
Because he hadn't met the criteria.
It was all too hypothetical, too dangerous.
I mean...
I knewJoe Ridley.
He didn't care about those kids.
He talked about them as iftheywere laboratory animals.
This terrible disease, progeria
he saw it as a wonderful opportunity.
He used those exact words with me once.
An opportunity to "unlock all the secrets."
When they refused to allow the human trials
he became enraged.
Doyou know what they called joe Ridley behind his back?
What?
Doktor Mengele.
So, how did Dr. Ridley
eventually lose his medical license?
He went ahead
with the human trials secretly
on an outpatient basis.
When we learned about it, ofcourse
we terminated his grant
and filed charges with the state medical boards.
I'm afraid your colleague, Dr. Ridley,
has dropped off the face ofthe earth.
Yeah.
Although it's rumored he went to South America
to continue his work.
Scully: You don'tjust reverse aging.
Ridley's found a way.
Listen to whatyou're saying.
He wanted human research subjects, right?
Prisoners likeJohn Barnett.
It's science fiction.
What would you have said 20 years ago
about gene splicing, DNA fingerprinting
cloning, artificial intelligence?
Maybe we're not looking for a man in his late 40s.
MaybeJohn Barnett has found the perfect disguise--
youth.
Mulder: I want to age him backwards now.
Let's start with ten years.
Now fiveyears more.
And add 20 pounds.
A healthy 20 pounds.
Scully: Ridley's notes from the human trials at N.I.H.
indicate he didn't see aging as inevitable
but as an opportunistic disease.
A disease that could be prevented, reversed even
by changing the chemical cues that trigger certain genes.
However, there is no evidence whatsoever
that Ridley's work yielded any results
or that his theories-- all hope to the contrary--
hold anyvalidity.
(creaking)
According to the leading scientificjournals
projections on this kind ofgenetic engineering
are at best speculative and futuristic.
(knocking)
(knocking)
Who is it?
Dr.Joe Ridley.
Ifyou're Dr.Joseph Ridley
where haveyou been for the past fiveyears?
I originally continued my research in Mexico
but for the last threeyears
I spent my time in Central America.
In Belize, to be exact.
What about Barnett?
john Barnett
is the only patient left.
The only one who survived the experiments.
What aboutyou?
My appearance is deceiving.
I have no more than a month to live
as I am dying from a rare cerebral vascular disease.
The same disease
that kills the kids suffering from progeria?
That's right.
An unfortunate side effect ofthe treatment.
By using the genetic components ofprogeria
I was able to reverse the aging process
the same way the disease expedited it.
At the same time, I and my patients
became genetically susceptible
to the same ailments
a child ofsix or eight would
ifhe had the disease.
What about Barnett?
john Barnett.
Ifl didn't so personally detest the man
I might call him my one triumph.
Barnett's not dying?
Only his eyes, which for some reason
do not respond to the gene therapy.
Otherwise,John Barnett appears to be thriving.
But how?
I varied Barnett's treatment.
Once I isolated the progeria receptors
I stumbled on something quite unexpected--
this same gene's related to the production ofmyelin.
The material that insulates neurons in the body.
Yes.
You see, myelin is not present in the veryyoung
and by reversing the effects ofaging
I found with Barnett
I was able to regulate the production ofmyelin.
Myelin being the material
that prohibits you or I from, say
regenerating a new hand
ifwe were to have ours cut off.
You were able to growJohn Barnett a new hand?
Not exactly.
Not a human hand, anyway.
I could never get the cells to divide or behave properly.
I'm afraid to ask.
What kind ofhand did you grow?
There had been some successful work
done in London.
By taking samples ofwhat we call cell morphegins
from an amputated salamander arm
and applying them to the back ofthe creature
theywere able to grow a new limb
on a different part ofthe body
but only on salamanders.
UntiIJohn Barnett.
Yeah.
Unbelievable.
Mywork has cost me dearly.
I'm an outcast in the medical community.
I was called Dr. Mengele, Dr. Frankenstein
but I didn't care.
Becauseyou knew that ifyour theories panned out...
The man who owns the fountain ofyouth controls the world.
When the A.M.A. censured me
certain sponsors came out ofthe woodwork.
One ofthem was the U.S. government.
They financed your research?
You might be more surprised to learn
just how high up the ladder this dirty little secret goes.
I know whyyou've contacted me.
Listen and I'll explain.
I am not proud ofthe way in which this matterwas handled
but like it or not, john Barnett is a fact oflife.
I wish Agent Purdue were around to appreciate the irony.
The government knew full well
that Barnett was in the country.
You, ofcourse, know
that Barnett stole all of Ridley's research.
Well, what Ridley doesn't know
is that our government is bargaining with Barnett
to buy it from him.
What does he want?
A lot ofmoney, immunity, safe haven.
Will he get it?
(laughing)
He holds all the cards.
You're aware that this freak ofscience
you're negotiating with is a murderer?
The information he has...
could change the course ofmankind.
Consider the options.
I will.
(phone ringing)
(ringing)
Hi. This is Dana Scully.
Please leave a message after the tone.
(beeps)
Electronic voice: Retrieving messages.
Hi, Dana. It's Mom. I just wanted to call and say hi.
Give me a call whenever.
Okay, hon. Bye-bye.
Hi, Dana. It's Cathy.
I hopeyou're going to meet me before my cello recital.
What's that?
It's my private answering machine.
At least it used to be.
This morning, I heard someone
dialing in my private code and replaying my messages.
Last night before Dr. Ridley arrived
I could have sworn someone was in my apartment.
When Ridley knocked
I thought I'd mistaken the noise for him.
This morning, I took this down to Prints.
john Barnett's left index oblique
is on the underside ofthis unit.
(phone rings)
Mulder.
(moaning)
Barnett?
(groaning)
Your new friend, Ridley...
Don't grow too fond ofhim, huh?
He's going to die soon like the rest ofyour friends.
The rest ofmy friends?
One by one.
You're not that smart.
(chuckles)
Tell me, you're not going to make me
prove it toyou again, areyou?
Oh, well, no matter.
It will beyour turn soon enough.
Well, you won't get that chance.
Oh, no?
(laughs)
Who's going to stop me, huh?
Man, this is... This is the land ofthe free!
Well, I'm just checking in.
Bye.
For now.
What does Barnett know aboutyour phone messages?
Uh, that my mother called for no reason
and I'm meeting a friend before her cello recital.
Where's that?
Mulder: Before the performance and during
we're working at a disadvantage
because we don't know exactly what Barnett looks like.
Study each ofthese faces.
Know them, particularly the eyes.
I'm including a diagram ofthe theater.
You have six front entrances and four more backstage.
We know that ifhe shows, he'll be keying on Scully
so wherever she is, she should not leaveyour sight.
We've got two hours before the performance.
Know this place inside and out.
We don't want any shots fired ifwe can help it.
We want to take Barnett alive, okay?
Howyou feeling?
It's the first time I've ever played the target.
Let's make sure it's not the last time.
(instruments being tuned)
Gun!
Down!
Check her out.
Stay back, Mulder!
Shut up!
Back off, back off.
Don't even think about it.
just let her go.
Go ahead and shoot.
Go ahead, man.
Shoot, Mulder.
What areyou afraid of, huh?
What, it's against regulations, huh?
No, man.
You need me alive, don'tyou?
'Cause I'm the one with the research, huh?
So I could shoot her!
And youjust have to live with it, don'tyou, huh?
Shut up!
How about it, Mulder?
Woman: Please.
Barnett: just like old times, huh?
Huh?
(gunshot)
(screaming)
Call an ambulance!
Man: It's okay, Scully. An ambulance is on the way.
Easy. You all right?
Don't try to move.
Where are they?
Can you hear me? Barnett.
Where did you hide them?
(all shouting)
How areyou feeling?
Like somebody kicked me in the ribs.
That bullet went through eight layers of Kevlar.
You're lucky to be alive.
What about him?
They few in three specialists to try to save his life.
That guy in the ugly suit is probably C.I.A.
He's been trying to talk to him.
Is Barnett conscious?
Yeah, but he's not talking.
Mulder, I know whatyou did wasn't by the book.
Tells you a lot about the book, doesn't it?
Barnett!
Come on!
Where are the papers? Come on!
Technician: Ten! Vitals dropping.
Barnett!
(heart monitor: even tone)
We're gonna hit him.
(all shouting)
Shock him now!
Woman: It's readywhen you need it.
Man: Stand clear.
Woman: He's going fast.
Scully: They lost him.
Bastard will take that research with him to the grave.
Where doyou think it is?
Mulder: Who knows?
If Barnett didn't destroy it, he could've stashed it anywhere,
which would have a certain cruel irony, wouldn't it?
Scientific knowledge that could change the course ofmankind
buried out in a field somewhere
or sitting in some safe deposit box
getting old, just like the rest ofus.
Scully: lfhe didn't destroy it, chances are
that somehow, someday somebodywill find it.
(ticking)
Mulder: And when they do?
Maybe he didn't get his revenge from beyond the grave
but somehow I feel like
we haven't heard the last fromJohn Barnett.
(ticking)

Excuse me. That's my house.
Okay, let her through.
What's going on?
Your husband has violated base security procedure.
He's commandeered a military vehicle,
is believed to be armed.
Team one moving in. Oh, my God.
You've got to let me talk to him.
What the hell?
We got him, but he's going to need a doctor.
Or something.
Hi. I got your message.
Sorry for the runaround.
Can I buy you a drink?
It's 2:00 in the afternoon, Agent Mulder.
That's not stopping the rest of these people.
I got something to show you.
Something you couldn't show me at work?
Let's get a table.
Okay.
MULDER: That's Colonel Robert Budahas.
That photo was taken last year
when he was a test pilot for the military
stationed at Ellens Air Base in southwest Idaho.
Four months ago, Colonel Budahas experienced a psychotic episode
and barricaded himself in his home.
The military police were called in.
Budahas was removed and apparently hospitalized
for the treatment of his condition.
Which was what exactly?
The military will not comment
on the cause, nature or status.
In fact, the military will not comment
on Colonel Budahas at all. What do you mean?
Mrs. Budahas has neither seen nor heard from her husband
in over four months.
Her inquiries to the military have gone unanswered.
Last month, she contacted the FBI
and reported it as a kidnapping.
What reason would the military have to kidnap
one of their own pilots?
That's the $64,000 question, Scully.
Since 1963, six pilots have been listed
missing in action from Ellens Air Base.
The military will say
only that these pilots accepted the risks
of flying experimental aircraft.
Yeah, there are rumors those pilots were
shot down at high altitudes while they were routinely
penetrating Russian airspace.
There were other rumors, too.
I've been tracking this case
since it came through the Boise regional office last month.
Last week, for reasons I can't figure out,
it was deprioritized.
They shelved this case without
an investigation, Scully.
So...
So you and I are going to the Spud State
to investigate a little kidnapping.
I don't get it, Mulder.
Does this have something to do with an X-File?
I thought you only liked those paranormal-type cases.
Am I missing something here?
Let's just say this case has a... distinct smell to it.
A certain
paranormal bouquet.
Excuse me.
Leave this case alone, Agent Mulder.
What?
The military will not tolerate an FBI investigation.
Who are you?
I, uh... can be of help to you.
I've had a certain interest
in your work.
MAN: Sorry.
How do you know about my work?
Let's just say that I'm a position to know
quite a lot of things--
things about our government.
Who are you?
Who do you work for?
It's unimportant.
I came here to give you some valuable advice.
You are exposing yourself and Agent Scully
to unnecessary risk.
I advise you to drop the case.
I can't do that.
You have much work to do, Agent Mulder.
Don't jeopardize the future of your own efforts.
You okay, Mulder?
Yeah. I'm fine.
Hello.
SCULLY: Mulder... Yeah.
I checked on that file you gave me.
You failed to tell me a few things.
This isn't some UFO goose chase you're leading me on, is it?
Are you there, Mulder?
Yeah.
Did you hear what I said?
Because the Bureau has it out for us already
and it would make us appear pretty stupid
if my field report read like some tabloid story.
Uh, listen, I don't want to talk about it on this line.
I'll talk to you about it on the flight out, okay?
Hello?
Mrs. Budahas?
Yes.
We're from the FBI.
Oh, yes.
Please, come in.
I started noticing it about two years ago.
Bob developed this rash under his arms.
We'd been doing some renovations on the house
so we thought it was a reaction to the paint stripper,
but then everything just went crazy.
SCULLY: How do you mean?
MRS. BUDAHAS: Bob's whole personality--
it was so unpredictable.
He started doing things...
What kinds of things?
MRS. BUDAHAS: It was kind of embarrassing at first.
We were having this dinner party once and, um,
he sprinkled Tetrameal D all over his food.
Hm...?
That's fish food flakes.
You ever talk to him about this?
I tried.
It was extremely difficult.
Bob would get so angry, he'd...
yell at the kids for no reason.
And then, and then he would shake
like he was having a seizure.
Did he ever talk about his work?
It was never discussed, even before the problems.
I knew that he worked on top secret projects--
word gets around--
but Bob was always
a patriot first.
He took loyalty to his country as an oath,
and now they treat us like strange...
I just want my husband back.
You know the government is not above the law.
They cannot withhold information.
And-and then I think...
well, what if he's...?
How would I support the family?
You said word gets around.
I'm sorry, um...
Have you ever heard of this happening to anyone else?
Um... yeah.
Verla McLennen's husband-- he went kind of crazy.
But it's not like he didn't get to come home.
How long has he been...?
Almost two years.
The fly-fishing idea was his brother Hank's.
I was upset, at first,
but when you're the wife of a test pilot,
you thank God just to have him home alive.
MULDER: Mrs. McLennen?
Has anyone ever offered to explain what caused this?
Stress, I guess.
You have to understand...
the military deals with things in a certain way.
They've given him plenty of therapy and treatment
and I'm thankful for that.
They've taken good care of us.
And, you know, they do volunteer for their jobs.
Really, Anita--
bringing the FBI to my house.
Here-- I've, um, I've called all the numbers
about a thousand times.
Please, let me know what you find out.
We'll be staying at the Beach Grove Motel,
if you need anything, okay?
Thanks.
Come on, kids.
So what did you make of Uncle Fester, down the block?
Oh... It's called stereotypy.
It's a syndrome produced by extreme stress.
P.O.W.'s have been known to suffer from it.
They've studied it in zoo animals.
Yeah, but these guys aren't zoo animals,
they're test pilots.
They're not supposed to fold under pressure,
they're supposed to thrive on it.
Ever hear of something called the Aurora Project?
Yeah, that's the unacknowledged code name for some new kind of
Defense Department surveillance project.
The Pentagon has all but admitted
they've been testing a secret class
of suborbital spycraft over the western U.S.
Maybe these guys are flying those planes.
Maybe these guys are the washouts.
You saw the photos on the wall in there.
This guy Budahas received a presidential commendation.
He's never washed out of anything in his life.
Been on hold with the base director of communications
for 45 minutes.
How about you?
Yeah, somebody named Colonel Kissel
will meet with us...
a week from Friday.
Yeah, right.
Did you say Kissel?
Colonel Kissel?
Yes?
Can I talk with you?
Special Agent Mulder, FBI.
I've got nothing to say.
Please! This is an invasion of my privacy.
Why don't you talk to us about Colonel Budahas?
Why don't you get the hell out of my yard?
Good thing we still kept that appointment.
MAN: Hi.
Are you the FBI agents?
I'm Paul Mossinger.
I, uh, work for the local paper.
We live a few houses down from Verla McLennen.
She said you guys are out here
looking into this Budahas thing.
We're just looking around.
I got you. Right.
A lot of people out here just looking around.
UFO nuts mostly,
but it's not every day we get FBI.
By the time you hear them, they're already gone.
So this Budahas thing-- are you getting anywhere?
We're not at liberty to comment.
Well...
Paul... right?
You've lived in this area a while.
You ever seen a UFO?
Never.
Bunch of hooey, if you ask me.
People see what they want to see.
But if I wanted to talk to one of those UFO nuts
that you referred to earlier, where would I go?
F-15 Eagle, pulling about four g's.
Those boys think they are such hotshots.
Get a few drinks in them, you'd think it was them up there
flapping their wings.
Who's the photographer?
WOMAN: Various and sundry.
I took the one on the end there.
MULDER: You're kidding.
Where?
Out on the back porch.
Taking out the garbage.
And there it was... just hovering.
Quiet like a hummingbird.
For a minute there, I thought
it was going to land in the parking lot
and I was going to serve 'em lunch.
I'm selling limited edition prints, $20.
Down to my last five, if you're interested.
Put it on my tab.
Sucker.
What would be the chances of someone like me seeing a UFO?
Catch you outside.
You want to see something weird, Mulder?
Ellens Air Base isn't even on my USGS quadrant map.
I know.
Let's go.
You know?
Where are we going?
We got our own map, sucker.
What do you honestly hope to see?
I don't know. Maybe nothing.
Is this why we came out here, Mulder?
To look for UFOs?
Yeah, this is going to look real good on my field report.
Scully, wake up.
You gotta see this.
What are they?
I don't know.
Just keep watching. It's unbelievable.
SCULLY: That's unreal.
I've never seen anything like it.
They've been going at it like that for almost half an hour.
So it can't be aircraft.
Aircraft can't maneuver like that.
What else could they be?
I don't know, lasers, maybe--
being shot from the ground, reflecting up off the clouds.
Oh, my God.
Here comes another one.
SCULLY: That's not a plane, that's a helicopter.
...come on!...
Hey! BOY: Let's get out of here!
Okay, don't shoot.
Stay right there.
We didn't do anything.
Come on!
That was extreme.
MULDER: Let's go.
You're coming with us.
BOY: What?
So, what exactly were you guys doing in there?
We were, um...
we were just...
We kind of have this spot.
You know, we go and we kind of kick back
and listen to some tunes and, uh, watch the air show.
Were you ever chased out before?
No... first time, right?
Our friend showed us the hole in the fence
about a year ago.
Oh! One time they dropped these bombs-- whoa.
Yeah, it was kind of heavy.
Oh, uh, there's this place
uh, called the Yellow Base, right?
Where they're supposed to store all this stuff.
And my friend said that there's land mines
all around it and junk like that.
I've got a 20. Over.
MAN: Roger, Redbird.
Assume fallback position.
We're opening the cage.
Redbird out.
Sometimes they come in real low
and just put on the skidders, right?
It's like...
and then they just hang there and hover
without making a sound, and you just think,
you know, who turned down the volume, right?
What do you think they are?
Okay, everybody thinks that they're, like, UFOs
but I think it's some kind of
Star Wars cybertech newfangled
hardware, right? I don't know,
they'll probably roll it out
for Desert Storm II or something like that.
Cruise right over Saddam's house, you know?
He'd be, like, what?
Do they look anything like this?
No.
They look exactly like that.
Thanks.
Later, dude.
What's that?
Evidence.
Kids today, huh?
You believe it all, don't you?
Why wouldn't I?
Mulder, did you see their eyes?
If I were that stoned...
Ooh! If you were that stoned, what?
Mulder, you could've shown that kid a picture of
a flying hamburger, and he would have told you
that's exactly what he saw.
All right, I want to show you something.
This is a photo of a UFO
that reportedly crashed in Roswell, New Mexico,
in 1947.
Now, I know you don't believe that story
but just hear me out.
Now, Ellens Air Base,
the same base that we're at right now--
the same base that, for some strange reason,
doesn't appear on your U.S. Government map--
is supposedly one of the six sites
where parts from the wreckage were shipped.
Mulder, are you suggesting
that the military is flying UFOs?
No.
Planes built using UFO technology.
Mulder, come on!
You've got two blurry photos
one of them taken almost 50 years ago
and another one you purchased today, in a roadside diner.
You're going out on a pretty big limb.
Tell me there isn't a remarkable resemblance.
Tell me one good reason
why either of these photos is authentic.
You saw exactly what I saw in the sky tonight.
What do you think they were?
Just because I can't explain it
doesn't mean I'm going to believe they were UFOs.
Unidentified Flying Objects.
I think that fits the description pretty well.
Tell me I'm crazy.
Mulder, you're crazy.
And it still doesn't explain to me
what happened to Colonel Budahas.
SCULLY: Thanks.
WOMAN: You're welcome.
You didn't come to raid my mini-bar, did you?
You ready for this?
What?
We got a message from Mrs. Budahas.
Her husband came home last night.
We got your message.
Mrs. Budahas, are you okay?
Come inside.
SCULLY: What is it?
What? What's wrong?
That...
is not my husband.
Honey...
who are these people?
That is not him.
That is not my husband.
They've done something to him.
What are you talking about?
It's okay, it's okay.
Just relax.
I'm Special Agent Mulder from the FBI.
We're out here investigating your disappearance,
Colonel Budahas.
I'm wondering if you have any explanation
of your whereabouts over the past four months.
I was in the hospital.
Here? On base?
I think so.
Colonel Budahas, do you mind if I ask you your birth date?
November 21, 1948.
And the names of your kids.
Josh and Leslie.
They're right there.
Yeah.
Green Bay fan.
Yes, sir.
Bet you remember
the Super Bowl of '68, huh?
Don Chandler.
Kicked four field goals.
Lombardi's last game.
Why do I have to answer these questions?
It's not him.
Colonel... Colonel Budahas,
you're a pilot, isn't that right?
Yes, sir.
Bet you've flown
just about everything with two wings.
I got this hotshot pilot friend
who said he could do an Immleman at a sustained eight g's.
Is that possible?
I... I don't...
I can't...
Anita...
I can't remember.
No...
Mulder, would you explain to me
what's going on?
I think they rewired that man's brain--
some kind of selective memory drain.
The brain doesn't work like that, Mulder.
You can't just go in there and erase certain files.
Then you explain it to me.
There are types of amnesia that...
This is not amnesia-- I think it's something
far more deliberate and insidious.
All I'm saying is that the science or medical technology
to do what you are suggesting does not exist.
And neither does the technology
to fly the aircraft we saw last night.
Listen to me, Scully, they can do this.
That man, he should have known the answer to the question.
It just wasn't in his head anymore.
SCULLY: Even if they could, why would they do such a thing?
To control information.
I think that after his psychotic episode,
Colonel Budahas became a security risk.
It couldn't just be that he had a nervous breakdown
with a concomitant memory lapse?
No, I think that men like Colonel Budahas
are physiologically incapable
of dealing with the stress of flying the aircraft we saw.
Of doing those maneuvers at those speeds.
I mean, we're talking about a technology
that is so sensitive and advanced
that it's taken almost 50 years to make it work.
UFO technology, Scully.
What the hell is this?! Hold on!
Please, step out of the car.
You think if maybe we ignore him,
he'll go away?
Please, step out of the car.
Guess not.
Special Agent Mulder, FBI.
Federal agents.
You want to tell me what this is about?
National security.
Now get in your car.
You'll be escorted back to your motel.
You'll pack and leave town immediately
or assume the consequences
of intense indiscretion.
Nothing under Idaho plate CC1356?
No plate registered under that number?
Thanks, Gail.
No, no, no.
I'm sure the other one's bogus too.
Bye.
So who were those guys?
I don't think it was those kids
they were chasing away from the base last night.
I think it was us.
They knew we were coming before we ever arrived
and they returned Colonel Budahas as a decoy.
There's something I didn't tell you, Scully.
Something else?
I was approached by a man in DC
who warned me to stay away from this case.
He didn't give me his name
and my phone was being tapped.
What?!
Why would they go
to all this trouble?
Out of a need for security?
Security of what?
I think there's a huge conspiracy here, Scully.
They've got a UFO here, I'm sure of it,
and they'll do anything to keep it a secret
including sacrificing lives and minds of those pilots
because what if that secret got out?
If-- if-- that were true...
it would be a national scandal.
No, no, you're not thinking big enough.
If it were true,
it would be confirmation of the existence
of extraterrestrial life.
Did you ever stop to think
that what we saw was simply an experimental plane
like the Stealth bomber or this Aurora Project?
Doesn't the government have a right
and a responsibility to protect its secrets?
Yes, but at what cost?
When does the human cost become too high
for the building of a better machine?
These are questions we have no business asking.
Our kidnap victim is no longer outstanding.
Let's get out of here, Mulder, while you still have a job.
Aren't you even curious?
Um...
I'm going to shower, I'll pack,
and then we'll get out of here.
Mulder!
Where are you going?
Right here.
Hey, aren't you guys coming?
No, we've...
you know, we've only gone in at night.
Okay.
This spot you told me about
where you watched the air show, how far is it?
45 minutes?
Will I be able to find it?
GIRL: Just stay on the path.
And what about this other place you told me about--
Yellow Base,
where they hangar them...? Don't. Don't even.
It's like... ten miles.
Nobody's ever... nobody's ever been that far!
Hey, don't go past the edge of the tall weeds.
Oh, man.
Did we tell him about the land mines and junk?
Hey!
SOLDIER: You got him! Go! Go!
No!
MAN: Come on, hold him.
Oxygen.
Yeah, I'm-I'm trying to make a call to Washington, DC,
and I can't seem to get a long-distance line.
Hello? Hello?
Excuse me.
Um, my phone's not working.
Can I use yours to make a credit card call, please?
Sure thing.
Thank you.
This one's not working either.
Phones are pretty undependable around here.
People say it's the military interference,
but they say that about everything.
Thanks.
Hi.
I was just looking for you.
I knocked but I saw the door was open.
I was in the lobby, trying to make a call.
Phones down again?
Yeah.
Base to Redbird.
Can you give us your position? Over.
Redbird, do you copy?
What are you doing?
Excuse me.
There's nothing in there.
Against the car!
Hands on the car! Do it!
Put the gun down, and we'll talk about it.
I said hands against the car!
Who are you?
You're a long way from home, Dr. Scully.
Nobody wants this to come to violence now.
Where's Mulder?
We took him to the base.
We waited for him.
I want you to get on that walkie-talkie
and find out where Mulder is.
I don't think I can do that.
I think you can
or I'm going to have every newspaper in America out here
writing about your experimental aircraft!
Vitals...
Respiration is normal.
Blood pressure... 120/50.
There are other ways to go about this.
Yeah, I've already seen
where you get with tears and a sad story.
Package is arriving...
Roger.
What are we doing?
Waiting.
I want the car running.
I said start the car!
And put your hands on the wheel where I can see them.
You do anything stupid
and this situation could get big in a hurry.
Yeah, you just keep telling yourself that.
MAN: Intruder arriving.
MAN 2: Copy.
I want you to keep the car running
and step out of the car.
Get in the car, Mulder.
Get in the car!
I just want to say, everything you've seen here
is equal to the protection we give it.
It's you who have acted inappropriately.
You okay, Mulder?
I think so.
Scully, I...
What?
How did I get here?
MULDER: Hi.
Hello.
We came by to see how your husband was doing.
Oh, he's fine.
He's getting much better now.
Do you think maybe we could see him?
Um, well, he's resting now.
BUDAHAS: Who is it now?
Thank you for your concern.
They got to her, Scully.
They were here.
They must've threatened her and Budahas--
That's enough, Mulder!
We don't know anything--
anything more than when we got here...
and that's what I'm going to write in my field report.
Let's get out of here, Mulder...
as fast as we can.
SCULLY: Lieutenant Colonel Robert Budahas
was returned to his home,
though his own knowledge of his disappearance and whereabouts
is vague and inconclusive.
Special Agent Mulder's insistence
that Budahas may have been a test pilot
on a top secret project
involving aircraft using "recovered UFO" technology
and may have suffered severe stress-related trauma
by flying these aircraft is also inconclusive.
Though this agent can corroborate
Agent Mulder's eyewitness account
of two unidentified flying objects
in the northern sky over Ellens Air Base,
their exact nature or design could not be determined.
Barring further authorized inquiry, this case...
Your lives may be in danger.
Why?
Mm, you've seen things that weren't to be seen.
Care and discretion are now imperative.
I saw something I...
As I said,
I can provide you with information
but only so long as it's in my best interest to do so.
What is your interest?
The truth.
I did see something...
but it's gone.
They took it from me.
They erased it.
You have to tell me what it was.
A military UFO.
Mr. Mulder, why are those like yourself
who believe in the existence of extraterrestrial life
on this earth not dissuaded by all the evidence
to the contrary?
Because... all the evidence to the contrary
is not entirely dissuasive.
Precisely.
They're here, aren't they?
Mr. Mulder, they've been here for a long, long time.

Don't you see?
It's so painfully obvious.
Why do you think our stock's in the toilet?
Because you're cutting research
and development in half.
You've forgotten what the adventure's all about.
Like it or not, the industry's changing.
We need to make some hard choices.
You save your sound bite for the press.
Let's not relive the stockholders meeting again.
Don't you get it?
You're killing me.
You're killing my company!
Eurisko is not your company, Brad, not anymore,
and you'd damn well better grow up and get used to it.
You're going to regret this.
New paragraph.
As I'm sure everyone on the board will agree,
Eurisko has to face head-on
the realities of an increasingly competitive world.
Since the unfortunate departure of Brad Wilczek, I have made
certain recommendations which I believe
will reposition Eurisko as an industry leader.
At the top of this list
is the immediate termination of the C.O.S. Project.
Its disastrous performance over the past three quarters
and projected losses well into 1994
leave us no other choice.
Hello? Hello!
At the tone, Eastern Standard Time will be 7:35 p.m.
What the hell?
Damn.
File deleted.
Mulder.
Jerry?
You're Dana Scully, right?
Jerry Lamana.
Jerry and I worked together in Violent Crimes.
Worked together? What are you talking "worked together"?
We were partners.
That's $8.50, please.
So, Jerry, what are you doing here?
Looking for you, and I'm buying you two lunch.
No, really...
No. It's on me.
Here.
Cause of death was electrocution.
And it wasn't accidental?
It looks like some kind of elaborate booby trap,
but we don't know a whole lot more.
Building engineer just found him 12 hours ago.
Who's running the investigation?
Either of you know Nancy Spiller?
The forensics instructor at the academy?
We used to call her the Iron Maiden.
On a good day.
Well, anyway, she's putting together the squad,
and, well, I took the liberty of mentioning your name.
Look, Jerry, I'd like to help you out,
but we're not on general assignment.
Because of the X-Files.
Look, the truth is,
I could use a little help on this.
I don't want to drop the ball on this one.
You won't drop the ball.
Drake wasn't just a CEO of a Fortune 500 company.
He was a good friend of the attorney general's.
Another feather in my cap would be really nice
right now 'cause the one I got is looking a little mangy.
Yeah, but, Jerry... Look...
I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important.
How come you two went your separate ways?
I'm a pain in the ass to work with.
Seriously.
I'm not a pain in the ass?
We had different career goals.
Jerry wanted the fifth floor.
And you?
I was gunning for a basement office
with no heat or windows.
Well, I know where you ended up.
What about Jerry?
He ran into a little bad luck in Atlanta,
working hate crimes.
What kind of bad luck?
He misplaced a piece of evidence,
bagged and everything.
Sent it to the cleaners.
By the time he got it back, a federal judge
had lost both his hands and his right eye.
29? Uh-huh.
Going up.
Must be for the visually impaired.
How do you like that?
A politically correct elevator.
Third floor...
fourth floor...
You okay?
Yeah.
What was that?
Yes?
Hello?
Security. Who's this?
This is Agent Dana Scully.
Agent Scully, do you have a problem?
Fifth floor...
Uh, actually, I think everything's okay.
All right. ...ninth floor...
Thank you. ...tenth floor, 11th floor...
See here?
Someone has tampered with the servo.
They switched the ground to the negative
so that when he put the key in the lock...
He completed the circuit.
It's fused.
It takes a lot of juice to melt a steel key.
And to throw a 180-pound man ten feet.
The, uh, servo switch-- could it have been moved manually?
We didn't find any prints in the surrounding area.
Sure, it could have been switched
manually, but whoever did it
would have had to override the C.O.S.
What's the C.O.S.?
The central operating system.
It runs the building.
Regulates everything from energy output
to the volume of water in each toilet flush.
This is Claude Peterson, he's the building systems engineer.
He discovered the body.
If somebody wanted to override the C.O.S.,
what would they...?
Well, first he'd have to break the access codes,
which-- well, let's just say it wouldn't be easy.
Well, we're gonna need a list
of all the people with that kind of know-how.
I can tell you right now,
it'll be a pretty short list.
Would you be on it?
Me? Yeah.
Hey, look, I'm just a glorified building super.
All I do is monitor the system,
make sure it's functioning,
like when I saw the overload in Mr. Drake's office.
What about the phone lines?
Does the C.O.S. monitor all phone calls?
Yes, it does. Why?
I'm just wondering.
Okay, um, look, can I go now?
Okay.
Why did you ask him about the phones?
Phone's off the hook.
Maybe Drake was talking to somebody
right before he did his Ben Franklin impersonation.
Taught him everything he knows.
Come in.
It's past 3:00.
I'm just looking for my profile notes.
Maybe if you cleaned your desk more than once a year.
They were right here, I'm telling you.
Come on, we're late.
Now, there are a couple elements
for us to consider here.
Both the statistical rarity of homicidal electrocution
and the complexity of the crime
indicate a certain devious premeditation.
After all, there are much simpler ways of killing someone.
All of which leads me to believe
that our guy was some kind of sociopathic game player--
maybe even a recluse,
since he designed a trap
not only to avoid detection
but to avoid contact with the victim.
Is that your profile?
Forget it, huh?
Drake's final phone call supports this theory.
At the tone, Eastern Standard Time will be 7:35 p.m.
Drake's estimated time of death.
Why would Drake call for the correct time
just before he died?
It was an incoming call.
From somewhere in the Eurisko building itself.
Whoever set the trap
wanted to make sure that Drake took the bait.
Excellent work, Agent Lamana.
Thank you.
Jerry, what the hell are you doing?
Hey, don't get all bent out of shape.
Jerry, that was my profile.
Look, I didn't think you'd mind.
Anyway, they were just notes.
I filled in the blanks.
Jerry, you went into my office
and you stole my work.
Look, you're on this case
'cause I asked you to help me out
and you helped me out.
What is the big deal?
What did he say?
He apologized... in his own way.
I just got off the phone
with Peterson, the systems engineer.
One name? Brad Wilczek?
He said it would be a short list.
And it's headline news how much this guy despised Drake.
That just seems too obvious.
To kill Drake would be so brazenly egomaniacal.
And fully consistent
with Jerry's excellent behavioral profile.
Fully.
So this is what a 220 IQ
and a $400 million severance settlement buys you.
Yes?
Brad Wilczek?
We're with the FBI.
What took you guys so long?
Oh, and do you mind taking off your shoes?
You can divide the computer science industry
into two types of people-- neat and scruffy.
I take it Benjamin Drake fit into the first category.
Neat people like things neat.
They wear nicely pressed suits
and work on surface phenomena--
things they can understand--
market shares and third quarter profits.
And you had a different vision
for the company?
I started Eurisko out of my parents' garage.
I was 22 years old, just spent a year
following around the Grateful Dead.
You know what Eurisko means?
Mm-mm.
That's from the Greek, isn't it?
Um... "I learn things."
Not exactly.
It means "I discover things."
Unfortunately, Ben Drake wasn't interested
in discovery.
He was a shortsighted, power-hungry opportunist.
Let me show you something: a smart home.
From this prototype, I have access
to every square foot of my house.
This place as safe as Fort Knox
and as energy efficient as your average igloo.
We were two years ahead of Microsoft and Cebus
when Drake, in his infinite wisdom, killed the program.
Mr. Wilczek,
is this system related
to the one in your corporate building?
Variation on a theme.
In your opinion,
how many people know the system
well enough to override it?
Finally, the bonus question.
"Not many" is the answer.
Could someone have, uh, hacked into the system?
Well, not your average phone freak, that's for sure.
But there's plenty of kooks out there.
Data travelers, electro-wizards,
techno-anarchists.
Anything's possible.
Could you have done it?
Of course.
I designed the system.
That's why you guys are here, isn't it?
I'm your logical suspect.
You don't seem too worried.
It's a puzzle, Ms. Scully,
and scruffy minds like me like puzzles.
We enjoy walking down unpredictable avenues of thought
turning new corners--
but as a general rule,
scruffy minds don't commit murder.
Some see genius as the ability to connect the unconnected--
to make juxtapositions,
to see relationships where others cannot.
Is Brad Wilczek a genius?
I don't know.
But I do know this for certain:
He has a predilection for elaborate game playing.
He has an intimate knowledge of the Eurisko building
and he has a demonstrable motive
for killing Benjamin Drake.
The question remains.
But if he's so clever, how do we nail him?
End of field journal, October 24, 1993.
File opened.
From the outset,
I knew that Eurisko would expand effectively,
not by traditional Western structures,
but by employing certain Zen beliefs
and other Eastern philosophies...
...and other Eastern philosophies...
...Eastern philosoph...
...Eastern...
Will you give me a second?
Look, I'm here with my hat in my hand.
I screwed up. I'm sorry.
What more can I say?
All you had to do was ask.
I would have helped you with the profile.
You don't know what it's like, Mulder.
What what's like?
You heard about Atlanta?
I gotta file daily reports like some cheery new agent.
That was bad luck.
That could've happened to anybody.
Not to you.
Don't run yourself down, Jerry.
You're a good agent.
We did some good work together...
Come on, let's face it. I was tagging along.
You were too busy dazzling them up there on the high wire.
Mulder... take a look.
We borrowed this
from the voice biometrics lab at Georgetown.
It's a computer spectrogram
capable of identifying individual speech patterns.
This is the recording
the central operating system made
of the phone call Drake received
just before he died.
At the tone, Eastern Standard Time will be 7:35 p.m.
And this we spliced together
from a series of lectures Brad Wilczek gave
at the Smithsonian last year.
At the tone, Eastern Standard Time
will be 7:35 p.m.
Now we'll stack them.
At the tone,
Eastern Standard Time will be 7:35 p.m.
You're saying this is the same person?
I'm saying that both voices are Brad Wilczek's.
He may have disguised his voice electronically,
but he couldn't alter the form
that's unique to his own speech patterns.
Which means that he was the one that killed Drake.
He had the motive and the means.
And now we have the physical evidence.
Judge Benson lives in Washington Heights.
I can get a warrant in less than an hour.
Someone has to make sure Wilczek stays put.
I'll go with you.
No. Let me bring him in alone.
I need this one, Mulder.
All right.
Come on, come on, let me in.
Damn!
Mr. Wilczek!
Going up.
Second floor, third floor, fourth...
Can I help you?
FBI.
Welcome back, Brad.
You're not equipped
with a voice synthesizer.
What is my user level?
That is now at the discretion of the operating system.
Going up.
Second floor, third floor, fourth floor
fifth floor, sixth floor, seventh floor, eighth floor
ninth floor, tenth floor,
11th floor, 12th floor, 14th floor
15th floor, 16th floor...
What the hell?
What are you doing?
Sorry. Those commands are not available
at your current user level.
Try again.
...23rd floor, 24th floor...
What are you doing?!
What are you doing?!
...27th floor...
...28th floor...
29th floor...
30th floor...
29-30, 29-30, 29-30, 29-30
Son of a... 29-30, 29-30, 29-30, 29-30
Oh, man.
Going down.
No!
Don't do this!
Oh, my God.
Program executed.
I heard about Jerry.
I'm sorry.
I don't think Wilczek did it.
What?
It doesn't make sense.
Why would he go back to Eurisko?
To destroy evidence, to cover his tracks.
If you were going to destroy evidence,
would you pose for the cameras?
Mulder...
you've been through a lot--
more than I think even you realize.
I think Wilczek is smarter than this.
He just signed a confession.
How much proof do you need?
Excuse me, sir, this is a crime scene.
You're gonna have to leave.
I know. I ordered the subpoena.
That subpoena's been obviated.
What are you talking about?
Unless you've got a code five clearance,
I'm going to have to ask you to turn back.
Thanks for coming.
I'm here against my better judgment.
In the future, I must insist
that you respect the terms of our arrangement.
I need to know why Brad Wilczek
is the subject of a code five investigation--
what the Defense Department wants with him.
What do you think they'd want
with the most innovative programmer in this hemisphere?
Software. Yeah.
For years, Wilczek has thumbed his nose
at any contract involving weapons applications.
He's a bleeding heart.
What kind of software?
How much do you know
about artificial intelligence?
I thought it was only theoretical.
It was, until two years ago.
Do you remember Helsinki--
the first time that a chess-playing computer
ever beat a grand master?
That was Wilczek's program.
And the rumor was that he did it
by developing the first adaptive network.
An adaptive network?
It's a learning machine--
a computer that actually thinks.
And it's, uh, become something of a Holy Grail
for some of our more acquisitive colleagues
in the Department of Defense.
They make me wear shoes all the time.
What else do you want from me?
I want you to tell me why you're willing
to spend the rest of your life in prison
for a crime you didn't commit.
What are you talking about?
I'm guilty.
I know you're innocent.
You're protecting a machine--
the central operating system at Eurisko.
If I'm protecting anything, it's not the machine.
Then what?
After the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
Robert Oppenheimer spent the rest of his life
regretting he'd ever glimpsed an atom.
Oppenheimer may have regretted his actions
but he never denied responsibility for them.
He loved the work, Mr. Mulder.
His mistake was in sharing it with an immoral government.
I won't make the same mistake.
But your machine killed Drake.
And it killed my friend.
I'm sorry about what happened, but there's nothing I can do.
And you talk about morality.
You're afraid of the government
but you're willing to accept the risk
that your machine will kill again.
The lesser of two evils.
What about a third option?
You created that machine.
Now you tell me how to destroy it.
Wilczek can create a virus
that will destroy the system.
Mulder, don't you see?
Blaming the machine is an alibi, and a bad one.
But it's the only thing that makes sense.
The C.O.S. Project
was posting big losses for Eurisko,
and Drake was about to terminate the program.
So the machine killed Drake
out of self-defense?
Self-preservation.
It's the primary instinct of all sentient beings.
Mulder, that level of artificial intelligence
is decades away from being realized.
Then why was our government
trying to usurp Wilczek's research?
Mulder, I think you're looking for something
that isn't there.
And I think it has something to do with Jerry.
Maybe it wouldn't be such a bad idea
if you talked to someone.
You're probably right.
Where are you going?
To talk to someone.
How much time do you need?
Hello...
Oh, my God...
This is Special Agent Dana Scully
I.D. number 2317-616.
I need you to run a quick trace on a number for me.
Yeah.
202-555-6431.
Yeah. That's my number.
Somebody's accessing my computer.
Mulder!
Scully, what are you doing here?
Someone or something's been scanning my computer files
tapping my phones.
I traced the line.
It came from somewhere in there.
It's the machine.
How can we get in?
You remember the Trojan Horse?
Open sesame.
Oh, what the...?
Mulder!
So much for the element of surprise.
What do you say we take the stairs?
28 down, one to go.
Oh, great.
Mulder?
Trick or treat.
No. Don't.
What are you doing?
I don't want to make the mistake Drake made.
Damn.
What are you looking at?
There should be a way for you to drop down and open the door.
Come on, Scully.
Scully?
Agent Mulder?
What are you doing here?
The machine's been acting all crazy.
Power surges, shut-offs.
That's why I'm here so late.
Where's the B port?
Oh, it's right back here.
Look, are you sure you know what you're doing?
Because, if you don't, it's my job on the line.
Damn.
System access granted.
User code, level seven.
Now I can put in the virus.
Not bad, Agent Mulder.
You know, I've been trying
to access the CPU for the past two years.
Now, please, take out your gun
and remove the clip.
Careful.
Defense Department?
Let's just say our paychecks are signed by the same person.
Now give me the diskette
and step away from the console.
You don't want to test my resolve, Agent Mulder.
Put down the gun.
Look, you may think you know what you're dealing with...
Shut up and drop the gun!
You're making a mistake, Agent Scully.
Compromising your sworn duty.
This operation is more sensitive than you can possibly imagine.
Don't listen to him.
The technology in this machine
is of enormous scientific interest.
The machine's a monster, Scully.
It's already killed two people.
They won't be able to handle it any better than Wilczek did.
Make no mistake...
you will be held accountable.
Mulder, put in the disk.
What are you doing, Brad?
Don't do this, Brad.
Brad...?
Brad, why are you doing this?
Brad...?
Brad...
Why?
I checked with Congressman Klebanow
and the Department of Corrections Subcommittee.
I even petitioned the Attorney General's Office.
You won't find him.
They can't just take a man like Brad Wilczek
without an explanation.
They can do anything they want.
Where is he?
In the middle of what we in the trade
call "hard bargaining."
Wilczek won't deal.
He'll never work for them.
Loss of freedom does funny things to a man
and remember, Wilczek confessed
to two murders, and you effectively destroyed
the only evidence
that could have exonerated him.
What else could I have done?
Nothing.
Unless you were willing to let the technology survive.
The Department of Defense still hasn't found anything?
They've been on it for five days.
Wilczek's virus was thorough.
It left no trace of the artificial intelligence.
The machine is dead.
We've pushed the pulse code modulations to the limit.
Nothing.
A "B" port crashed.
We've combed the parsing subroutine.
Yes, sir. Twice.
No, sir, still nothing, but I'd like to request...
Yes, sir.
No, I understand.
Yes, sir.
Well...
six more hours
before we have to consign the whole damn thing
to the metal shredder.
We'll do what we can, sir.
Proximity detectors burned; no capacity.
I can't follow his circuitry at all.
I'm going to figure this thing out
if it kills me.

Woman On Radio: Rogeryour request for assistance.
What is your present location?
Unit 50, go ahead.
Suspect is now westbound.
Has entered the gate
ofthe shipworks.
Unit 50 still in pursuit. Over.
Officer On Bullhorn: Pull yourvehicle over and stop!
Putyour hands on the roofand freeze!
Hold it!
(Men Grunting)
Get on the ground!
Do it!
Did you hear me?
Face down!
Do it!
(Grunting)
(Grunting)
Stop!
Armed officer!
(Gunshots)
I hit him.
I know I hit him.
Where the hell did he go?
He'd be bleeding bad.
...offthe coast ofltaly.
But theirs is a very light lava.
That's what stumped me.
Because inside there must be something
the weight ofthe heaviest rock.
But, Professor, that would be lcelandic peridotite.
Precisely.
There's a piece chipped off.
By me.
Well, what's the rock inside?
Icelandic peridotite, naturally.
When I saw this, I stopped chipping.
(Phone Rings)
Mulder.
Areyou watching channel eight?
What's your conclusion?
Science does not jump to conclusions.
Science is not a guessing game.
ended early this evening--
the suspect eluding capture by leaping into the harbor
but not before injuring several Ardis police officers.
We have Captain Roy Lacerio standing by.
How was the man able to escape
and how seriously injured were the officers involved?
Those details are still unclear.
I'll be talking with several...
I'm sorry-- You'll have to excuse me.
Captain Roy Lacerio being pulled away here
during an intense manhunt.
...Lacerio being pulled away here
during an intense...
Mulder, you've been through this tape 1 00 times.
What exactly areyou hoping to find?
Mulder: I don't know.
And all he told you
was to watch channel eight?
Yeah, that's all he said.
Do we even know why the suspect
was being chased?
As far as I can tell
he wouldn't pull over for a moving violation.
Well, that should put him
on the ten most wanted list.
There must be something here.
Some detail
we're not seeing.
How doyou know he's notjustyanking your chain?
Well, he has admitted lying toyou.
He wouldn't call ifthere wasn't something here--
something he wants me to see.
Then what areyou missing?
There were three law enforcement agencies
out here last night.
Hunting a man on a moving violation?
I know it's not Silence OfThe Lambs
but it's what we do.
This man isn't wearing a badge or a uniform.
He's not one ofyours?
No, sir.
But it was a zoo out here.
You say the suspect was shot.
Why hasn't the body been recovered?
We got our search ongoing.
We're quite certain he will be found.
It's been almost 1 8 hours, Captain.
Where could the body be?
There are cables and debris all over the bottom.
It's a painstaking business.
Can I askwhat the F.B.I.'s interest in this case
would be?
The suspect matches the description
ofa federal fugitive.
Really? How's that?
No description ofthe suspect has been released.
Ifyou don't mind, can we take a look
at the car, please?
It's been taken to impound.
The report says that the car was registered
to a rental agency in Gaithersburg.
They had no idea the carwas even missing.
You know, Mulder
I think that we're wasting our time here.
I don't know what the hell I'm supposed to find.
You can't make out the license plate in this photo.
Scully, look at this.
What?
Look at the car in the photo.
Look at the windshield.
It's not the same car.
Scully: It's called a caduceus.
It's the adopted symbol
ofthe medical profession.
So probably only a doctor would have that on his car.
Mm-hmm.
I had the picture enhanced.
The plate is different.
"3 A-Y-F."
Fast-forward.
That's all you can make out.
The rest is obscured.
Hey, Danny, it's Mulder.
Run a Maryland plate for me.
All I got is a partial.
Registered to a doctor, or used to be.
Yeah, I'll hold.
They switched cars and lied about it.
Whywould they do that?
Maybe the real owner ofthe car has something to hide.
(Animal Squeals)
Mulder: Dr. Berube?
Yes?
We're with the F.B.I.
Can we have a minute?
I'm very busy.
Areyou aware that a car registered toyou
was involved in a high-speed chase
in Ardis yesterday?
Excuse me?
A silver Ciera, Doctor.
Doyou own one?
Yes.
It was used forwhat?
A crime.
Wereyou aware it was even missing?
Not until now.
I have a housekeeper, and she often uses the car.
It's a second car...
Please!
They should not be excited.
Nothing should be touched.
I thought theywere friendly.
They're part ofan experiment.
What kind?
Am I under
some kind ofsuspicion?
No.
Then I think I've answered all your questions.
Excuse me. I have more work than time.
Thankyou.
Did he biteyou?
No, but he tried to.
Well, it's almost 5:00.
Let's check with the doctor's housekeeper
about the car.
No.
No? What doyou mean?
This has reached the point ofabsurdity.
We're out here on halfa hunch
offa cryptic phone call
chasing down a clue that's based on speculation.
Well, that's all we've got.
That's all he's given us.
Who is this Deep Throat character?
We don't know anything about him.
He's in a delicate position.
He has access to information
and indiscretion could expose him.
You don't know that this isn'tjust a game.
He's toying with you.
Rationing out the facts.
You think he does it because he gets offon it?
No. I think he does it becauseyou do.
Calling it a night
Mr. Mulder?
My mother usually likes me home
before the street lights come on.
I'm surprised atyou.
Why?
Your level ofcommitment seems to have diminished.
My level ofcommitment?
I expected thatyou'd be working through the night
putting the pieces together.
Maybe ifyou'd given me something more to workwith.
I've given you all I can.
A news report?
And where has it led you?
Not very far.
It may be further than you realize.
This has always been on your terms.
I've been the dutiful son.
This time we canjust cut out the Obi Wan Kenobi crap
and save me the trouble.
I fearyou've become too dependent on me.
Look, I've got plenty to do
without chasing down yourvague leads
or trying to decode your circular logic.
Maybe it's you who's become too dependent on me--
on mywillingness to playyour games.
Mr. Mulder?
What?
Don't give up on this one.
Trust me.
You've never been closer.
Closer to what?
(Door Opening)
Hello?
Hello?
Who's there?
Working late tonight, Doctor?
What doyou want here?
He's alive, isn't he?
Has he contacted you?
Please.
You're going to have to leave.
(Banging Cage Violently)
Ifyou're from the F.B.I.
I've already answered all your questions.
What questions?
I had nothing to say to them.
I have nothing to say toyou.
Where's Doctor Secare?
I don't know whatyou're talking about.
Please.
Mywork is very important.
I must get on with mywork.
I'm afraid...
yourwork is done.
(Loud Shattering, Equipment Falling)
Anybody see anything?
No.
Nothing.
I'm calling it off.
Let's get those guys out ofthe water.
Yes, sir. Bring it in.
On the preliminary reports
it's being listed as a suicide.
Suicide?
They think that, forwhatever reason
he trashed his lab and then killed himself.
How?
He tied one end ofa roll ofmedical gauze
around his neck
and the other end to this gas outlet.
Then hejumped.
Were there anywitnesses?
Nope.
He kept this place
Iike he was waiting for the people
from Good Housekeeping to show up.
I would never have pegged him to do this...
or a Greg Louganis out the window.
Scully: I know. That gauze is troubling.
It's a bit too calculated, huh?
As ifsomeone wanted to make doubly sure
he'd break his neck before he hit the ground.
What else do we know about Dr. Berube?
Um...
"Terrence Allen Berube.
Harvard Med, 1 974."
He was working
on the Human Genome Project.
Areyou familiar with that?
Yeah. The mapping ofall human genes.
Maybe the most ambitious scientific endeavor
in the history ofmankind.
There's nothing extraordinary about that.
There were thousands ofscientists
working on that project.
But only one who owned a silver Ciera
and went bungeejumping
with medical gauze wrapped around his neck.
I'm seeing the pieces
but I'm not seeing the connection.
Mulder: Maybe that'sjust it.
Maybe we're not seeing it
because it can't be seen, not in any obvious way.
What is this?
I don't know.
Can you find out?
What will you do?
I'll see what else I can find out about Dr. Berube.
Okay, Mulder, but I'm warning you.
Ifthis is monkey pee, you're on your own.
(Doorbell Rings)
My first impression is
it's some kind ofbacteria specimen.
Can I askyou whereyou got it?
It was recovered at a crime scene.
We've come a long way
from Colonel Mustard in the den with a rope, haven't we?
I'm expecting
it will turn out to be nothing.
No. You've definitely got something here.
Wow. Look at this.
Scully: What are they?
They're the size ofbacteria
but no bacteria I've ever seen.
How doyou mean?
Well, most bacteria are symmetrical and smooth.
These are...
I don't know. It's strange.
You have no way ofidentifying them?
Well, we could do a freeze fracture.
Take a thin slice off
and see what's going on inside these babies...
ifyou don't mind waiting.
No. No, I'll wait.
Hi, Danny. Yeah, it's Mulder again.
Look, I've got a number this time--
555-2804, area code 301 .
I need an address, a name ifyou can get it for me.
All right. I'm at, uh...
same prefix, 1 51 7.
All right. Thanks, Danny.
(Ringing)
Mulder: That was fast.
Man's Voice: Terry, is thatyou?
Yeah.
Who's this?
They shot me, Terry.
Oh, God.
I've been in the water for three days.
I'm hurt.
Where areyou now?
At a pay phone.
I'll pickyou up. Where areyou?
Terry...
You okay?
Areyou there?
Hello?
Hello. This man's been hurt here.
I think he needs medical attention.
What's the street? What's the street?
I'm going to call an ambulance.
Sir?
(Telephone Ringing)
Don't hang up.
You got it.
Hi, Danny.
I got it.
Let me get the address.
All right, you ready? Mulder?
I'm just writing it down now. Go ahead.
Belongs to a company called Zeus Storage. 1 61 6 Pandora.
Zeus Storage. Yeah.
1 61 6 Pandora Street.
That's it.
All right, thanks.
(Siren Wailing)
severe dyspnea and hypotension.
He also has a green fuid
coming from a wound
right upper quadrant.
Doctor: ls he responding to CPR?
No, and we're noticing rope veins at the neck
and a hypersonant sounding chest.
He's going real blue on us now.
Release the air pressing on the heart cavity.
I'm going to need a cannula.
We're going to do a needle decompression.
(Air Rushes Out)
Ah...
(Coughing)
Doctor: What's going on in there?
(Coughing)
Answer me.
What is the problem?
Come in, please!
(Telephone Ringing)
Mulder.
It's me.
He's alive, Scully.
Who?
The driver ofthe silver Ciera.
He called the doctor's house.
Where is he now?
I don't know. Where areyou?
I'm at the Georgetown Microbiology Department.
I've got something foryou.
Is it smaller than a silver Ciera?
Much.
And it's not silver. It's green.
What is it?
Some kind ofbacteria, each containing virus.
Berube may have been cloning them.
They also contain something that looks like chloroplasts--
plant cells.
They've never seen anything like it.
What could he have been doing with them?
The only reason you clone a virus inside a bacteria
is to inject it into something living.
It's called gene therapy
and it's still highly experimental.
Maybe that's what he was doing with those monkeys.
Can they tell you anything else?
They'rejust about to run some primary cell cultures
and a DNA sequence.
Now, I may be understating the strangeness ofthis, Mulder.
Bacteria like this--
it may have existed, but not for millions ofyears...
not since before our ancestors first crawled out ofthe sea.
Areyou there, Mulder?
Yeah.
Scully, keep up the good work.
Agent Scully.
Oh, Dr. Carpenter, I fell asleep.
I've done some work.
These are the DNA sequences
from the bacteria sample you brought in.
You know something about molecular biology.
What areyou looking at?
I think those are genes.
Right. They're called base pairs.
Each pair is made up
ofsomething called a nucleotide.
Only four nucleotides exist in DNA, four.
And through some miracle ofdesign
that we haveyet to fathom
every living thing is created
out ofthese four basic building blocks.
Whatyou're looking at is a sequence ofgenes
from the bacteria sample.
Normally, we'd find no gaps in the sequence.
But with these bacteria, we do.
Why is that?
I don't know why.
But I tell you, under any other circumstances
my first call would have been to the government.
What exactly did you find?
A fifth and sixth DNA nucleotide--
a new base pair.
Agent Scully
whatyou are looking at
it exists nowhere in nature.
It would have to be by definition...
extraterrestrial.
(Ringing)
Hello.
Mulder? Where on God's Earth haveyou been?
I've been trying to call you all night.
I had a situation.
I left my phone in the car.
Mulder...
that bacteria I had analyzed--
They're saying that it doesn't exist in nature.
They're saying that it could be extraterrestrial.
Scully...
What?
How soon can you be here?
There's something I gotta showyou.
Wait a second.
Mulder...
I just want to say that I was wrong.
That's all right. Don't worry about it.
No, um...
ifyou'd have listened to me, we wouldn't be here right now.
I should know by now to trustyour instincts.
Why? Nobody else does.
You know, I've always held science
as sacred.
I've always put my trust in the accepted facts.
And what I saw last night...
for the first time in my life, I don't know what to believe.
Whatever it is you do believe, Scully
when you walk into that room...
nothing sacred will hold.
There were tanks here...
and five bodies suspended in solution.
There were computers monitoring them.
Theywere alive, Scully, underwater.
What happened to them?
God only knows.
Most likely
they've been destroyed.
Miss Scully.
We met ever so briefy.
Destroyed bywhom?
I don't know.
I don't believeyou.
There are limits to my knowledge
Mr. Mulder.
Inside the intelligence community
there are so-called black organizations--
groups within groups conducting covert activities
unknown at the highest levels ofpower.
There were three men-- I was chased.
Ifyou were chased, you would have been killed.
Those men are trained well
for that sort ofbusiness.
Were those the same men
who killed Dr. Berube?
Presumably.
Why?
Why? Good Lord.
You've worked so hard
and you still don't see it.
Dr. Berube was conducting human experiments
with extraterrestrial viruses.
Yes, but that's been going on foryears.
We've had the tissue since 1 947
but not the technology.
Roswell?
Roswell was a smoke screen.
We've had a halfa dozen better salvage operations.
Dr. Berube was killed
because his work was too successful.
You're standing in the room
where the first DNA transplant took
the first human-alien hybrid was created.
Six volunteer patients
all terminally ill.
One, Dr. William Secare, an old friend
of Dr. Berube's
was dying ofmelanoma cancer.
And as a result
ofthe E.T. gene therapy
all six patients treated in this room
began to recover from their illnesses.
Dr. Secare was able to live
a more or less normal life--
as normal as possible
for a man who has developed inhuman strength
and the ability to breathe underwater.
That's how he eluded capture.
What was he running from?
Dr. Secare was never supposed to have survived.
Dr. Berube's research was part
ofa top secret government project.
All theywere interested in was the technology.
To have a hybrid living out in the real world--
too great a liability.
What ifhe should need
emergency medical procedure?
The man has a blood chemistry
that is alien
and very likely toxic.
That story should hit the press.
It was easier to kill Dr. Secare.
Ofcourse.
There was only one problem.
Dr. Berube was able to warn him.
There'sjust one thing I don't understand--
whyyou gave us so little to go on in the beginning.
And why areyou giving us so much now?
I didn't anticipate the speed and precision
oftheir cleanup operation.
They're systematically destroying all the evidence--
Dr. Berube, the bodies here.
Without the evidence
you two have no case.
Who would believe the story
I just told you?
You must put together
everything thatyou have found
and you must find Dr. Secare before they do.
I'll have no further contact with you on this matter.
I'm going to get back to Georgetown
and get all the lab work.
I'm going to find Dr. Secare.
Where?
I don't know. I'm going to trust my instincts.
I'm looking for Dr. Ann Carpenter.
I've been unable to reach her by phone
and she's not in her office.
She was in a terrible car accident...
herwhole family.
And Dr. Carpenter is, um, dead.
(Thump)
(Thump)
Dr. Secare?
Wait!
I'll protectyou.
(Gunshot)
(Air Rushes Out)
Ah...!
(Coughing)
(Ringing)
Your cellular phone's been ringing offthe hook.
I'm a popular guy.
Why don'tyou answer it for me?
Oh, I don't like talking on the phone.
I have this thing about unsecured lines.
When you feel like talking
Iet me know, though.
He's not home.
Where is he?
He's been gone all night.
I wish I knew.
Something's happened to him.
Theywon't kill him.
How doyou know that?
He's become too high-profile
and you've got evidence that could expose them.
They took the evidence
and they may have killed in order to get it.
The evidence still exists.
Where?
It might be difficult to obtain
but with your medical background
I might be able to getyou inside.
Inside where?
The high-containment facility
at Fort Marlene, Maryland.
What do they have there?
The wellspring, Miss Scully--
the original tissue.
Ifthey've got Agent Mulder
they might be willing to make a deal.
It could save his life.
(Click)
Name?
Dana Scully.
Company or institution?
Federal Government.
Project password?
Project password?
Purity Control.
Log in, please.
You're late.
Doyou have it?
Yes.
Good. They're willing
to make the exchange.
You spoke to them?
Yes.
I'll take the parcel.
No, sir.
I'll make the exchange.
I made the deal, Scully.
They're expecting me.
I don't trustyou.
There's no one else to trust.
I don't know whoyou are.
I know nothing aboutyou.
For God's sake
don't screw this up.
In 1 987, a group ofchildren from a Southern state
were given what their parents thought
was a routine inoculation.
What theywere injected with
was a clone DNA
from the contents ofthat package
you're holding as a test.
That's the kind ofpeople you're dealing with.
So, why give it back to them?
To save Mulder's life.
At the risk ofother lives?
You and Mulder are the ones who can bring it to light.
Now, give me the parcel.
Give me the parcel, Scully.
No!
Mulder. Mulder.
Trust...
trust...
no one.
(Telephone Ringing)
Hello.
Mulder: Hey, Scully, it's me.
Where areyou?
They're shutting us down, Scully.
What?
They called me in tonight
and they said
they're going to reassign us to other sections.
Who told you that?
Skinner.
He said word came down from the top
ofthe executive branch.
Mulder...
It's over, Scully.
Lodge a protest. They can't...
Yes, they can.
What areyou going to do?
I'm...
not going to give up.
I can't give up...
not as long as the truth is out there.

The kids.
Boy: Mom! Mom! Mom!
Kevin.
Mom! Ruby's gone!
Ruby?
Ruby?
Ruby?
Ruby?
Ruby!
<font color="#00FF00">X-Files</font> Season 1 Episode 04 - Conduit
Blevins: Agent Mulder's latest 302
requesting assignment and travel expenses
for the both of you.
Sioux City, lowa.
That's the first I've heard of it.
It came up through channels
from Mulder's ASAC to the district G-1 4
and onto my desk.
I don't understand.
In essence, Mulder is petitioning the bureau
to assign a case number
to a tabloid headline.
He must have more evidence than...
Not according to his 302.
I admit, that is strange...
even for Mulder.
Perhaps it has something to do with this.
Take a look.
An <font color="#00FF00">X-File</font>?
Has he shared any of this with you?
There's no need to protect him.
He's the agent of record. He initiated the file himself.
She was his sister.
She disappeared 21 years ago.
He was 12 and she was 8.
He claims that he was in the room when it happened.
He recalls a bright light outside the window
and, uh... and a presence in the room.
In your opinion
has Agent Mulder's personal agenda
clouded his professional judgment?
In my opinion, no.
But you can see how it might appear that way.
As you know,
Agent Mulder's preoccupation with fringe matters
has been a big source of friction in the Bureau.
This is another case in point.
I'm going to disallow the 302.
With respect, sir,
at least let me talk with him
and make a recommendation.
It just doesn't seem...
substantial enough to warrant an investigation.
Okay, Scully, so we disagree.
It's not the first time, and it won't be the last.
At least if we had a legitimate source...
This is the essence of science.
You ask an impertinent question
and you're on your way to a pertinent answer.
What makes this case any more credible
than the hundred-year-old mother with the lizard baby?
Because the lizard baby
wasn't born anywhere near Lake Okobogee.
- Oko-what? - Bogee.
Okobogee.
Is that supposed to mean something to me?
If you know anything about trout fishing
or U.F.O. hot spots.
Define hot spot.
Four sightings in 1967, August
including one by a National Weather Service plane.
This is a light-blasted, digitally enhanced enlargement.
The pilot took that photograph?
Try a Girl Scout with an Instamatic.
Four of the nine girls in the troop claim to have seen something.
Five, if you include the den mother.
The air force said it was a weather balloon caught in a wind shear
but there wasn't a weather balloon
launched that day within 700 miles.
Read me the names of those Girl Scouts from 1967.
Lisa Terrel, Bonnie Winston, Doreen Mccallister, Darlene Mor--
It's the same Darlene Morris.
Ms. Darlene Morris?
l'm Agent Scully, and this is Agent Fox Mulder.
We talked with you on the phone last night.
Please, come in.
Well, l knew that if I screamed loud and long enough
that someone would listen
but l never expected the F.B.l.
Uh, this is Kevin.
Kevin, say hi.
Would you like some coffee?
Mmm.
Some days, l can't even...
get myselfup out of bed
and... Kevin has been acting so strange.
I don't know what to do anymore.
I just want her back again.
Ms. Morris
during the divorce, was there a custody battle?
Charles had nothing to do with this.
How can you be so sure?
Because I know what happened.
It'sjust like it was before.
Summer of 1967? The Girl Scout troop?
- How did you know? - Your name's on record
at the Center For U.F.O. Studies in Evanston, lllinois.
Really?
Yeah, a pilot for the National Weather Service
made a sighting over the same area on the same day.
They took her, didn't they, Mr. Mulder?
You said that Kevin was there the night it happened?
He didn't see anything. He was asleep.
Do you think I might talk to him anyway?
- Mmm. - Thanks.
You know...
I've told the story so many times now...
Oh, to the newspapers and the police...
And every time I tell it
people get this look in their eye
just like the look
that you've got right now.
Hey, buddy.
You mind if I sit down?
Thanks.
Your mom tells me you've been having nightmares.
I guess so.
- You want to tell me about them? - No.
All right.
What are you doing?
You making something?
Can I take a look at it?
Thanks.
It's coming from there.
The TV?
I don't know what it is. May be a binary sequence of some kind.
Could be anything, could be nothing.
I know you're busy. Look, I know a friend
who knows a friend who knows a friend
who can get you a ticket to a Redskins game.
You got it. All right.
You know where to find me? Thanks, Danny.
As I was telling your partner, we found no evidence of kidnap.
No phone call, no ransom note
and since we didn't turn up a body...
You assumed she ran away.
Well, it wouldn't be the first time Ruby Morris ran away from home.
How do you explain what her mother saw?
I think that Darlene has a very active imagination.
I've been listening to those stories since the first grade.
So, basically, you ignored her statement.
I included it in my report.
But you didn't bother to check it out.
We went out to the campsite. We didn't find anything.
Darlene's little girl was no prom queen.
I can't count the number of times I pulled her out of parked cars
or found her puking her guts out by the side of the road.
It was just a matter of time before...
Before what?
Before something bad happened to her
and if Darlene needs to make up crazy stories to get past that, fine,
but don't tell me to treat it as the truth.
I'm not going to waste my time.
I just think it's a good idea
not to antagonize local law enforcement.
Who? Me? I'm Mr. Congeniality.
You never know. We might need his help one of these days.
I'll send him a bundt cake.
You're looking for Ruby, right?
That's right. Who are you?
It doesn't matter.
Are you a friend of Ruby's?
Ruby didn't have friends.
She just had people she liked to hang with.
And she liked to hang out with you?
I guess we had some times.
Like the night she disappeared?
It was Greg. She was supposed to see him that night.
Who's Greg?
Her boyfriend, Greg Randall.
They were supposed to meet up at the lake.
They had stuff to talk about.
What kind ofstuff?
Greg got Ruby pregnant.
I don't know, whatever, she got herself pregnant.
Do you know what they were planning to do about it?
They were going to leave town. At least, that's what Ruby told me.
You know Greg from school?
Greg? School?
I don't think so.
All he ever did since we met him
was pour beer at the Pennsylvania Pub.
Excuse me.
What kind of trouble's he got himself into now?
Actually, we were hoping you could tell us.
Greg called in sick three weeks ago, man.
I haven't seen or heard from him since.
Any ideas where he might have gone?
No, but if you find him, tell him he's fired.
This is the hotel we'll be staying at if you hear of anything.
That's a nice tattoo. What is that?
What's it look like?
A fying saucer.
You don't really believe in that stuff, do you?
I take it you don't?
No, l think it's all just a bunch of crazy people
howling at the moon.
So, you haven't been out to Lake Okobogee, have you?
No, I haven't. Why?
You should ride with us sometime.
You might see some things that will change your mind.
Get a killer sunburn in the middle of the night.
Where's Mulder?
Where did you get the document?
If you explain what you're talking about, maybe I can help you out.
This is a document?
just looks like a bunch of ones and zeroes to me.
- Tell me where you got it. - Tell me what it is.
Keep playing games
I'll haul your ass up in front of the D-6.
You can explain to them what you're doing obstructing justice.
It's your call, Holtzman.
Unless they tell me otherwise
I'm not accountable to anybody outside my subcommittee.
I don't care if it's the N.S.A. or the Vatican Police.
It's a defense satellite transmission.
You're kidding.
just a fragment, but highly classified.
We need to know where it came from.
Well, sure, I'll let you know as soon as I find out.
That's it, Mulder.
You just bought yourself a one-way back to Washington.
We got it.
Great.
What?
You shouldn't have told them. They have no jurisdiction.
Mulder, they're N.S.A.
They think the boy may be a threat to national security.
How can an eight-year-old boy who can barely multiply
be a threat to national security?
People call me paranoid.
How did Kevin obtain top-secret information?
Where do you think he got it from?
It's okay, baby. Don't worry.
- lt will be okay. - Agent: Come with me, son.
Mom!
It will be all right, baby.
You guys do really delicate work.
- Let's get this to Cryptography. - Let's go.
Think we got what we needed. Thank you.
What is it?
I'm not sure.
We scanned all 77 pages through the mainframe.
And none of the information is actionable.
Other than the satellite transmission
nothing can be construed as a security risk.
The boy's being released this afternoon.
So it was just a random set of ones and zeroes?
On the contrary, there was nothing random about it.
I don't understand.
All information can be rendered digitally
in a series of ones and zeroes.
When we downloaded the data, we found an amazing range...
Well, see for yourself.
Da Vinci's Universal Man.
A DNA double helix.
There's lots more.
- That's from the Brandenberg Concertos. - But they're just fragments.
A few notes here and there
some lines from the Koran, a Shakespearian sonnet...
Almost like someone switching channels, huh?
- Mrs. Morris... - I have nothing to say to you.
Mrs. Morris, please, give me a minute to explain.
Would you please just wait right over there for Mama?
I'll be right there.
l thought you were both here to help us.
Scully: This has been a terrible mistake
and I assure you that the government
will pay for all damages.
I don't want your money. I want my daughter back
and l want you to leave us alone.
But your son has seen something.
You stay away from me, and you stay away from my child.
Come on, honey.
It's okay. Let's go now.
l thought we were headed back into town.
Where are we going?
The boy's the key, Scully. I know it.
The key to what?
Finding Ruby.
Think about it for a minute.
This is a boy who is receiving digitized data
from a television screen.
Agent Atsumi said it was a statistical aberration.
A link or a connection to whoever...
or whatever took Ruby that night.
But how?
If there was an abduction
it's likely that Kevin was touched in some way.
Mulder, l know what you're thinking.
I know why this is so important to you.
I know.
But there is no evidence indicating an abduction.
That's why we're going to Lake Okobogee.
According to the police photos
Ruby and Kevin were sleeping right here.
just a stone's throw from the forest wall.
Meaning what?
Meaning anybody could have come out of the forest to grab her.
Have you noticed the tree line?
Evidence of extreme heat.
Or an electrical storm.
Besides which, there's nothing
to connect it to the night of Ruby's disappearance.
That's true.
Do you think a lightning strike could have caused this?
Do you have any idea at what temperature sand solidifies into glass?
2,500 degrees fahrenheit.
Something was out here, Scully--
something hot enough to turn sand into glass
to singe those trees
and to blister the roof of that camper.
look.
What is it?
It's a grave.
Shallow, by the smell of it.
Mulder, what are you doing?
Mulder, you are disturbing a crime scene.
Stop!
What if it's her?
I need to know.
You okay, Mulder?
I'm fine.
Looks like a male caucasian.
Sir.
Victim's name was Greg Randall.
Ruby's boyfriend.
Ruby had a lot of boyfriends.
Before you put that away, can I look at it?
Go right ahead.
Look at that.
That's her-- the girl from the library.
Who?
We didn't get her name, but she claimed Greg and Ruby had run off together.
Doc Fowler's a buddy of mine.
Delivered both my kids.
I can find out who had that appointment.
Scully: Have a seat, Tessa.
We know that you lied to us the other day.
We know that you had the appointment
with Dr. Fowler on August 7.
We know that you're the one that's pregnant, not Ruby.
You don't know nothing, do you?
We can prove it, Tessa
and we can prove that Greg was the father.
So what if he was the father?
This is very serious.
Do you understand how serious this is?
Now, you've waived the right to an attorney.
So if you lie to us here today
you could be charged with perjury.
He promised me we'd be in L.A. by Christmas.
He had a friend there.
And I'd never seen the ocean.
You said that he and Ruby were seeing each other.
You said that they were planning to meet at the lake.
Is that true?
I was nowhere near the lake that night, okay?
Sure you were, Tessa.
You knew they were meeting, so you sat there and you waited for them.
You were angry and you were jealous.
- I wasn't. - You sat there and you waited.
When they showed, you killed him first. Isn't that how it went?
Bam!
And then you killed Ruby. Bam!
What was she doing right before she died, Tessa?
Was she pleading for her life?
Was she running away?
- I didn't kill her! - Where's she buried?
- I didn't kill her! - You didn't?
She wasn't even there that night!
Well, how would you know that, Tessa
if you weren't there yourself?
Mulder, you're not seeing the whole picture.
- Which is? - ln all likelihood, Ruby is dead.
ls thaty our conclusion or the conclusion
of the Sioux City Sheriffs Department?
They're searching the national park
and a rescue dive team is coming in from Des Moines to drag the lake.
They're wasting their time.
Do you really think Tessa Sears is telling the truth?
Why not? What if Ruby never did show up that night?
She lied to us in the library and about her pregnancy.
What makes you think she wouldn't lie to us about killing Ruby?
Because something was out there in those woods.
We have a suspect in custody.
We have a confession to one murder
and we have a statement which speaks to the intent to commit another.
It's over, Mulder.
It's time to go home and turn this over to local law enforcement.
I can't do that.
- Mulder, where are you going? - To talk to the boy.
Darlene won't even let you in the door.
Well, I've got to see him.
They don't want to have anything to do with us.
Stop running after your sister.
This won't bring her back.
Come with me, or don't come with me
but until they find a body, I'm not giving up on that girl.
Mrs. Morris?
Kevin?
Mulder?
What does it mean?
I don't know.
I'm going to check upstairs.
Oh, my God.
What is it?
just come up here.
Look.
It's her. It's Ruby.
This is a long shot. They could be anywhere.
You know, when I was a kid
I had this ritual.
I'd close my eyes before I walked into my room
because I thought that, one day, when I opened them my sister would be there
just lying in bed, like nothing ever happened.
You know, I'm still walking into that room...
every day of my life.
Scully!
Darlene!
Look. There's a trail head.
- Are you okay? - It's here.
- I saw it. - Where's Kevin?
- I couldn't keep up with him. - Go ahead.
Kevin!
- Arecyou okay? - She's back.
Kevin, I'm sorry, but...
She's here. I know it.
Kevin, I don't think she is.
I know how much you wanted it to be her.
- I did too. - Scully: Mulder!
Come on.
Scully!
Ruby!
She's unconscious, but she's still alive.
I'll get help.
The nurse says she's been awake for almost an hour.
Any ideas what caused the coma?
There's no sign of head trauma.
No narcotic traces, or electrolyte abnormalities
except her white blood cell count was sky-high.
Was there a reduction in the lymphocyte population
or release of glucocorticoids?
Um...
Actually, both.
How did you know that?
They're symptoms of prolonged weightlessness.
Shuttle astronauts have reported similar imbalances.
Hi, Ruby.
Who are you?
We're with the F.B.l.
l'm Special Agent Dana Scully, and this is Fox Mulder.
My mom said you might be coming by.
How are you feeling?
Fine, I guess.
Where were you, Ruby?
Can you tell us?
Kevin: It's okay, Ruby.
He knows.
I'm not supposed to tell.
They told me not to say.
Who told you?
Ruby, who told you?
Darlene: Sweetheart,
you don't have to say anything.
You're right.
We should wait till Ruby gets a little stronger.
Could we speak outside for a moment?
I think that it's best that we put all of this behind us.
Hasn't Ruby been through enough already?
I know how disoriented she must seem right now
but in a couple of weeks, maybe even a few days...
I don't want her talking to you or anyone.
She should be encouraged to tell her story.
It's important that you let her.
Important to who?
I have my daughter back. I don't want any more trouble.
Besides, she hardly remembers anything.
She will remember one day, even if it's only in dreams.
And when she does, she's going to need to talk about it.
Like I did?
Listen to me. All of my life
I have been ridiculed for speaking my mind.
But it was the truth, Darlene.
The truth has caused me nothing but heartache.
I don't want the same thing for her.
It doesn't have to be that way for Ruby.
As far as I'm concerned
she spent the last month on the back of a Harley-Davidson.
Is that what you're going to tell Kevin?
I'm sorry.
Werber: But your eyes are open?
Mulder: Yeah, they're open.
But it's like nothing's happening.
Try turning your head.
I can't.
Why not?
I don't know.
I can't move.
So I don't.
I just lie there in bed.
Can you see your sister?
No, but I can hear her.
What is she saying?
She's calling my name
over and over again.
She's crying out for help
but l can't help her.
I can't move.
Are you scared?
I know I should be, but I'm not.
Do you know why?
Because of the voice.
- The voice? - The voice in my head.
What's it telling you?
Not to be afraid.
It's telling me that no harm will come to her
and that, one day, she'll return.
Do you believe the voice?
Do you believe the voice?

ï»¿1 Here, let me do it.
Put your number in, then your card.
What's your number, Roland?
Three-fifteen.
See how easy it is?
Engine efficiency: 94%.
We need more.
How's the back pressure holding?
What do you think? It's climbing.
Increase the blade inclination.
I said increase the blade inclination!
Inclination of the blade is pi over nine.
We've reached maximum velocity.
No!
Let it go!
It will work.
It's just going to destroy itself!
I'm not going to do that.
It's not going to destroy itself.
Come on! We're almost there!
There's something wrong with our equations.
What happened? Nothing.
Because Surnow pulled the plug.
I'm just protecting the baby-- and four years of work, Frank.
Four years of work that's going to add up to zilch.
Because, unless we show some progress,
they're going to pull the plug on us, Ron.
He's right, you know.
You should have continued with the test.
Somebody's going to crack mach 15,
and I want that someone to be us.
And I'm not going to jeopardize everything
just because you two guys
can't wait to see your name in print.
It's the print that gets the money, Ron.
If you want to go down in flames together, fine.
You go ahead.
I'm going to do the math.
Good night, Dr. Keats.
What the hell?
Roland.
Open the door.
Open the door!
Roland, I want you to listen to me very carefully.
We have to open this door, Roland.
Stop typing!
Roland!
Roland! Open the door!
What are you doing?!
Open the door!
Roland, hit "escape." Are you listening?
How was the wedding? You mean the part
where the groom passed out or the dog bit the drummer?
Did you catch the bouquet?
Maybe.
So, is that what you couldn't
talk to me about over the phone?
The project that everyone says doesn't exist does exist.
The Icarus Project?
The next generation in jet engine design.
Capable of doubling current supersonic speeds
using half the fuel-- at least in theory.
And Ronald Surnow was an aeronautical scientist
who worked on it here at the university.
Yes. How close are they?
I'm not sure, but Surnow's the second scientist
on the team to die in the last six months.
Okay, but how is this an X file?
Mulder, you don't think
this has anything to do with UFO technology?
There's something unexplainable here, Scully,
but it's certainly not unidentifiable.
Keats?
There.
Dr. Keats?
We're with the FBI.
I'm Agent Mulder. This is Agent Scully.
We understand you discovered Dr. Surnow this morning.
What was left of him.
How do you suppose he became trapped in the wind tunnel?
Someone must have shut him in.
The door can only be opened or locked from in there.
By computer?
We've already been through this with the police.
How many times do we have to rehash it?
Another member of your team died a short time ago.
Isn't that correct? Yes.
Arthur Grable.
He was killed in an automobile accident
in November.
I'm Frank Nollette.
I'm also on the project.
Are you certain it was an accident?
What are you driving at?
Your work seems to be
a perfect target for industrial espionage.
Who wrote this?
Ron was working on it when I left.
You see, the handwriting here
doesn't seem to match
any of the other handwriting on the board.
It isn't mine.
What about Roland Fuller?
Uh... Roland's the, uh... janitor.
Well, according to the police report,
he was the only other person here last night.
Roland didn't do that.
How do you know?
Let's just say
Roland isn't exactly a rocket scientist.
Here.
"Tracy."
With stars.
Roland.
There are some people here who would like to talk with you.
Uh-oh.
I went off the paper.
Sorry.
That's all right, Roland.
Tracy?
Would you like to come help me in the TV room?
Okay.
Thank you.
Hi, Roland.
You mind if we sit down?
Eh...
Thanks.
You mind if we ask you a couple questions?
Do you remember working last night?
Uh-huh.
Do you remember seeing anything unusual?
Seeing any strangers?
Did, um... did Dr. Surnow
or Dr. Keats or Dr. Nollette do anything unusual?
Nope.
You must like stars.
One hundred and forty-seven.
Sorry?
Stars.
You like numbers, too, huh?
Roland, let me help you.
One, two,
three, four, five,
six, seven... Roland?
Is everything okay?
...eight, nine...
Roland, are you all right?
...ten, eleven,
twelve, thirteen...
What happened?
What did you say to upset him so?
...sixteen, seventeen...
It's definitely the work
of a fourth and distinct individual.
Dr. Surnow's, Dr. Keats'
and Dr. Nollette's cursive standards
don't match what you found on the white board.
Will you do me a favor and try this?
What is it?
That's something Roland was doodling at the home.
You don't really think that Roland...
Besides Nollette and Keats, he's the only person
we can prove was in the lab that night.
Yes, but we're talking
about a sophisticated fluid dynamics equation.
Roland Fuller barely has an IQ of 70.
Well, you saw his facility with mathematics.
Don't some autistic individuals display unusual abilities?
Yes, but even savants
behave only as human calculators.
I mean, they can perform certain functions,
but they can't tell you the value of anything
or even the meaning of a number.
I hate to take sides, guys,
but the bottom line is no.
The terminal stroke on the six,
the roof on the five...
I'm sorry.
He didn't write it.
An organic object exposed to liquid nitrogen
at minus 320 degrees will become frozen,
exhibiting great tensile strength,
but is vulnerable to stress from compression or impact.
Now, I've seen this demonstrated on a fish before...
I don't think they'll be performing
this experiment on Beakman's World.
Has this been dusted?
Treat yourself.
Thanks.
Hey, Scully, look at these files.
"KMAN" must be Keats.
His file was turned off at 12:31 last night.
But look. Someone else entered a file
under the name "Arthur" after 12:31.
And worked on it for nearly five hours.
Well, it couldn't have been Keats.
Judging from the rigor of the body,
he was dead around 12:30.
So you're saying that someone came in here,
killed Keats, and then just did some work
on an old Dr. Arthur Grable file?
Well, I can't access the Arthur file.
We're going to need the password.
Try 15626.
How did you know that that was...?
This is Arthur Grable's work
on the same fluid dynamics equations
the others were working on.
Look at all those entries.
Someone has been continuing his work
for the six months since he died.
How did you know what the password was?
Wave good-bye. Wave good-bye.
Come on. We've got to go.
Wave good-bye. Bye-bye.
Roland?
Why did you sleep in your clothes last night?
Well, let's get you dressed.
You have visitors.
I'm not supposed to talk to them.
Who told you that?
Remember that talk we had
about being shy?
These are nice people, Roland.
Hey, Roland, you got more shirts than I do.
I think this one would look stylin' today.
What do you think?
The green one.
Green one?
Please.
Mrs. Stodie, can I talk to you a second?
See you later, Roland.
This one?
Here you go.
So, do you like your job at the college, Roland?
Yes.
I hear you're very good at it.
Do you remember how you got your job?
A man talked to Mrs. Stodie.
What man?
Dr. Grable.
Was Dr. Grable nice to you?
Yes.
When was the last time you spoke to him?
Last week?
Day before?
Dr. Grable died.
I'm sorry.
Yes.
People die.
They go away,
and they're not supposed to come back.
Has Roland ever mentioned
the name "Arthur"?
That was Dr. Grable's first name,
but we only called him Dr. Grable.
I doubt Roland even knew his first name was Arthur.
Mrs. Stodie, can I get a copy
of Roland's file and past history?
Our patients' histories are confidential.
I understand, but I have grounds to obtain them,
and the less time we have to spend in court,
the more time we have to help Roland.
Roland Fuller was hired by Arthur Grable.
He went to the halfway house
specifically to find a mentally challenged person.
Are you suggesting that Arthur Grable
hired Roland in order to use him?
Then are you suggesting that Arthur Grable is not dead?
Well, if he had intentions
of killing Nollette, Keats and Surnow,
why not set it up to appear the least likely suspect?
Yeah, but by the look of this, he's hamburger.
Maybe he staged it.
That would explain why his work is continuing on
six months after his "death."
This obituary says
that Arthur Grable was born in Seattle.
His father was a big banker.
His mother was active in a number of charities.
Only child.
Summa cum laude in physics.
Doctoral and postdoctoral
in aeronautical engineering at Harvey Mudd.
Brilliant future, tragically cut short.
Roland's also from Seattle.
He spent most of his life at the Heritage halfway house.
The identity of his parents has been sealed by the courts.
There's very little information on Roland
before the age of three.
That's when he was put in the Heritage program.
Does it say when he was born?
July 15, 1952.
That's also Arthur's birth date.
Don't you wish you could fly?
I can.
When I dream.
People can do anything in a dream, you know.
Once...
one time, I had a dream we were married
and lived in a house.
Do you have dreams, Roland?
You can tell me.
Roland?
Who's Arthur?
I'm sorry, Roland.
I'm sorry.
Roland!
Go away!
Roland, what's the matter?
Go away!
I don't want to hurt you!
Go away!
Go away.
Is that you?
Yes.
Cool do.
What's the story here?
Um... a quantum physics professor of mine
at Harvey Mudd flunked me.
He challenged the tenets of one of my theories--
a theory I later published in Nature.
Anyway, to get back at him
one afternoon, we decided to take his car apart
and put it back together again in his office
and left it running.
Hmm, an egghead classic.
It was Arthur Grable's idea.
Is that Arthur Grable there, sitting on the chair?
Yeah.
Was he a practical joker?
Atop of all his brilliance
he had a genius for executing elaborate schemes.
Could he be making it seem like a man with a 70 IQ
is gaining access to and operating
his old computer files?
Arthur would still have to be alive.
Could he have faked his own death?
No. The police report
on the auto accident that killed Arthur Grable
is woefully incomplete.
It was a dry road surface, no mechanical problems found.
The body was never admitted to a county morgue
and there was no funeral.
If, uh, you are trying to suggest
that Arthur Grable killed Surnow and Keats
and is after me next, you're way off.
Art could not have done the murders.
How can you be so certain?
This is Arthur Grable.
Because of the massive internal damage to his body
caused by the car accident, we could only preserve the head.
Wouldn't your client find it somewhat inconvenient
to be thawed out in the future, only to discover
he had no functional mobility?
We believe that, by the time science figures a way
to revive our clients...
You'll also know how to clone new bodies for them.
Exactly.
This technology is progressing faster
than anyone thought possible.
Ask anyone here at the university.
So, while for us, the passing of each second
brings our bodies closer to death,
for our clients, it brings them closer to life.
These fluctuations in temperature--
with Dr. Grable's capsule, and our technicians
have checked it for possible malfunctions,
but they've found nothing.
Is it possible the brain is causing the fluctuation?
No, but we are looking for the explanation.
The patient's in no danger.
He remains perfectly preserved
as long as there's liquid nitrogen in the capsule.
May we take a look at Arthur Grable's records?
Thank you.
Dr. Barrington,
in your conception of future medical science,
what requirements will exist
to be an organ or tissue donor?
Same requirements as there are today.
Compatible genetic makeup.
It's best if the donor is related.
Mulder...
Arthur Grable put down only one donor.
Roland Fuller and Arthur Grable had the same birthday.
I think they're twins.
Older or younger?
Same age,
just less hairy and with better eyesight.
Got you, and the moustache?
No. Lose the whole beard.
Next?
Close-cropped hair
with a slightly receding widow's peak.
Lose the glasses.
That's Roland.
Give or take a few pounds.
Tell me about your dreams, Roland.
It's all right. I won't tell anybody.
You know, I had a dream last night.
I dreamt I was swimming in this pool
and I could see my father underwater,
but when I dove down, the water stung my eyes.
Then there was another man at the pool, watching me.
He upset me.
He was asking me questions I didn't want to answer
and I had to leave.
I couldn't find my father.
I can't tell you my dreams.
Why not?
Bad.
Your dreams are bad, Roland,
not you.
You're a good person.
I hit Tracy.
Your dreams make you hit Tracy?
You know how to work this toy, Roland?
Here.
You see, the way you work that toy
is like what's happening to you.
You're the spaceship, Roland,
and your dreams are the controls.
Who...?
Who runs the controls?
Have you seen this man recently?
Come on, Arthur, we have to say bye-bye to Roland.
Bye.
Roland.
Roland, stop.
We need to arrange to keep Roland under observation.
Roland.
He's trying to get away. Roland.
Nollette's gone.
We should arrange a security guard to find him.
Mulder, no one's going to provide you with anything
once you explain your theory
on how Roland Fuller is capable of these murders.
You've got a brother, don't you, Scully?
Yeah, I've got an older one and a younger one.
Well, have you ever thought about calling one of them
all day long, and then all of a sudden the phone rings,
and it's one of them calling you?
Does this pitch somehow end with a way for me
to lower my long distance charges?
I believe in psychic connections,
and evidence suggests that it's stronger between family members,
strongest of all between twin siblings
that shared the same womb.
Okay, maybe, but in this case
one sibling has closer ties to a frozen Fudgsicle
than he does to his own brother.
Arthur Grable is not dead.
He's in a state of consciousness
that no human has ever returned from.
And what if that state allows one to develop psychic ability
to a potential that the conscious mind
is too preoccupied to explore
or believe in?
He could use that ability to control his brother
to kill those scientists.
But why? He's been working with these colleagues for years.
Well, that's a question that only Dr. Nollette can answer.
Okay, let's go.
I have to call my brother.
We've got to find Nollette.
Let's talk to Campus Security.
We go this way?
No, we go left.
Well, wherever you are, Arthur,
I'm sure you'll appreciate this.
Arthur and Roland Grable.
Born at Puget Presbyterian to Mr. and Mrs. Lewis Grable
on July 15, 1952.
Arthur was four minutes older than Roland.
Identical twins.
Which means that they're the result
of a single egg fertilized by a single sperm.
I've read studies which suggest that,
in some cases, the identical twin arises
very early in the embryonic stage
when a mutation in one cell
is rejected by the other cells
as foreign.
So, then, maybe Roland's condition
is the result of a damaged chromosome
rejected by one of Arthur's cells?
In a way, that would explain Arthur's genius
and Roland's strange mathematical gift.
In a way.
Agent Scully.
This is Larry Barrington at the Avalon Foundation.
We've, uh, got a situation here.
Last night we had a break-in at the facility.
That's right, yeah.
It's Arthur Grable's storage unit.
His internal thermostat's been compromised.
Was there any tissue damage?
We're trying to assess that now.
The temperature's still rising.
Something's blocking our access
to the cooling program.
Someone tampered with Arthur Grable's capsule.
They're attempting to stabilize it now.
Nollette.
What is it?
"If I have seen further than other men,
it's because I have stood on the shoulders of giants."
No.
This isn't yours.
It's amazing.
There's this body sitting there
in front of me talking,
but you're controlling it, Arthur.
You took my work.
What good was your work going to do you?
You died before you could finish it,
before you could publish it.
It was mine!
And a brilliant piece of work, too.
When I saw the writing on the white board,
I knew someone had found the key.
Mach 15 was within our reach.
Our futures were guaranteed.
Ironic, isn't it?
You did all the work
and I get all the glory.
No!
Yes.
Yes, Arthur.
I was here working on the intake problem,
moments away from a solution, when you attacked me.
Fortunately I was carrying a gun.
After the murder of my colleagues,
who could blame me?
No.
Oh, that's, that's interesting.
I've got it.
That's it.
I've got it.
Arthur!
Arthur, open the door!
Arthur, how do you stop this?!
Tell me how!
Arthur! Wait!
Roland, we need you to help us.
Please, we need you to help us
to stop the machine.
Bye, Roland.
Arthur, say good-bye
to your brother.
Try to remember how.
Roland, you've got to help him or he's going to die.
Wave good-bye, Arthur.
Come on, Roland.
I can't remember.
He'll be held
in psychiatric custody for evaluation.
Is he being charged with a crime?
The D.A. hasn't made that determination yet.
But we've recommended that he be remanded to your custody
as soon as the court deems it appropriate.
How could this happen?
Roland never exhibited any violent tendencies.
It's my belief that he wasn't acting under his own volition.
What do you mean?
This is the work of Arthur Grable,
Roland's brother.
It's a new theory of jet propulsion,
unfinished at the time of his death.
In the last two weeks
Roland has completed the calculations.
How?
We're not sure, Mrs. Stodie.
All we know is that Roland was somehow able
to finish his brother's research.
Roland?
Where are you going?
Roland, don't go.
I have to.
Okay. Bye.
Tracy...
wait.
Keep my stars.
I love you.
Me, too.

They put the time of death between eight and twelve hours ago.
No visible cause, no sign of battery or sexual assault. All we have is this.
Can we turn her over?
- Karen Swenson. - Is that a positive I.D.?
She went to school with my son.
Would that be the class of '89 Detective?
It's happening again, isn't it?
Agent Dana Scully.
Man: Come in.
Agent Scully, thank you for coming on such short notice. Please.
- You've been with us just over two years. - Yes, sir.
You went to medical school, but you chose not to practice.
How'd you come to work for the F.B.I.?
Well, sir, I was recruited out of medical school.
My parents still think it was an act of rebellion
But l saw the FBl as a place where l could distinguish myself.
Are you familiar with an agent named <font color="#00FF00">Fox Mulder</font>?
Yes, I am.
- How so? - By reputation.
He's an Oxford-educated psychologist
who wrote a monograph on serial killers and the occult
that helped catch Monty Propps in 1988.
Generally thought of as the best analyst in the violent crime section.
He had a nickname at the academy:
<font color="#9e9e9e">Spooky</font> Mulder.
Well I'll also tell you is that Agent Mulder has developed a consuming devotion
to an unassigned project outside the Bureau mainstream.
Are you familiar with the so-called <font color="#00FF00">X-Files</font>?
I believe they have to do with unexplained phenomena.
More or less.
The reason you're here is we want you to assist Mulder on these <font color="#00FF00">X-Files</font>.
You will write field reports on your activities
along with your observations on the validity of the work.
Am I to understand that you want me to debunk; the <font color="#00FF00">X-Files</font> project?
We trust you'll make the proper scientific analysis.
You'll want to contact Agent Mulder shortly. We look forward to seeing your reports.
Sorry, nobody down here but the F.B.I.'s most unwanted.
Agent Mulder.
I'm Dana Scully.
I've been assigned to work with you.
Isn't it nice to be so highly regarded?
Who did you tick off
to get stuck with this detail?
Actually, I'm looking forward to working with you.
I was under the impression that you were sent to spy on me.
If you have any doubt about my qualifications...
You're a medical doctor.
You teach at the academy.
You did your undergraduate degree in physics.
"Einstein's Twin Paradox: A New lnterpretation."
Dana Scully's senior thesis.
Now that's a credential, rewriting Einstein.
Did you bother to read it?
I did. I liked it.
In most of my work
the laws of physics
rarely seem to apply.
Maybe l can get your medical opinion on this.
Oregon female, age 21 .
No explainable cause of death.
Autopsy shows nothing. Zip.
There are, however, these two distinct marks
on her lower back.
Dr. Scully, can you I.D. these marks?
Needle punctures, maybe.
An animal bite, electrocution.
How's your chemistry?
This is the substance found in the surrounding tissue.
It's organic.
I don't know.
Is it some kind of synthetic protein?
Beats me.
I've never seen it, either
but here it is again
in South Dakota, and again in Texas.
Do you have a theory?
I have plenty of theories
but maybe what you can explain to me
is why it's Bureau policy
to label these cases as "unexplained phenomena"
and ignore them.
Do you believe in the existence of extraterrestrials?
Logically, I would have to say no.
Given the distances needed
to travel from
the far reaches of space
the energy requirements would exceed
a spacecraft's capabilities.
Conventional wisdom. This Oregon female--
she's the fourth person in her graduating class
to die under mysterious circumstances.
When convention and science
offer us no answers
might we not finally turn to the fantastic
as a plausibility?
The girl obviously died of something.
If it was natural causes, it's plausible
there was something missed in the postmortem.
If she was murdered
it's plausible there was a sloppy investigation.
What I find fantastic is any notion
that there are answers beyond the realm of science.
The answers are there.
You have to know where to look.
That's why they put the "I" in F.B.I.
See you tomorrow morning, Scully, bright and early.
We leave for the very plausible state of Oregon
at 8:00 a.m.
Pilot: l'd like to ask all passengers to fasten their seat belts
as we're about to make our descent...
This must be the place.
You didn't mention yesterday this case has already been investigated.
Yeah, the F.B.I. got involved after the first three deaths
when local authorities failed to turn up any evidence.
Our boys came out here, spent a week enjoyed the local salmon,
which, with a little lemon twist, is just to die for. If you pardon the expression.
Without explanation they were called back in,
the case was reclassified and buried in the <font color="#00FF00">X-Files</font> until l dug it up last week.
And you found something they didn't?
The autopsy reports of the first three victims show no unidentified marks or tissue samples
but those reports were signed by a different medical examiner
than the latest victim.
That's pretty good, Scully.
Better than you expected, or better than you hoped?
Well, I'll let you know when we get past the easy part.
Is the medical examiner a suspect?
We won't know that  until we do some grave digging.
I've arranged to exhume one of the other victims to see if we can get a tissue sample
to match the girl's.
- You're not squeamish, are you? - I don't know. I've never had the pleasure.
What's going on?
- What the hell was that about? - Oh, you know ... Probably nothing.
Mr Mulder, John Truitt, County Coroner's Office.
Yeah, hi. This is Agent Scully. How soon can we get started?
- We're ready to go. - Oh, great!
Were you able to arrange for an examination facility?
- We got something for ya. - Excuse me! Excuse me.
No.
Please.
Please stay in the car.
I just don't know who you people think you are.
You think you can come up here
and do whatever you damn well please, don't ya?
I'm sorry. You are..?
I'm Doctor jay Nemman, I'm County Medical Examiner.
Surely you must have been informed of our intentios to come up he....
No. No, we've been away.
Well, that answers a question we had:
why you hadn't done the recent autopsy on Karen Swenson.
You're aware of the tissue sample
that was taken from the girls body.
What, what is the insinuation here?
Are you saying that I missed something in those others kids' exams?
We're not insinuating anything, sir.
Wait a minute!
Well, I think you are.
If you're making an accusation
then you'd better have something to back it up.
Daddy, please, let's just go home.
Let's go home, please!
Guy obviously needed a longer vacation.
Ray Soames was the third victim.
After graduating high school
he spent time in a state mental hospital.
treated for post-adolescent schizophrenia.
Soames confessed to the first two murders.
He pleaded to be locked up
but he couldn't produce any evidence
that he committed the crimes.
Did you happend read the cause of death?
Exposure. His body was found in the woods
after escaping the hospital.
Missing for only seven hours in July.
How does a 20-year-old die of exposure
on a warm, summer night in Oregon?
This isn't official procedure.
Really?
It's probably a safe bet Ray Soames never made
the varsity basketball team.
Seal this up right now.
Nobody sees or touches this. Nobody.
This is amazing, Scully.
Do you know what this could mean?
It's almost too big to even comprehend.
The subject is 1.56 centimeters in length
weighing 52 pounds in extremis.
Corpse is in advanced stages of decay
and desiccation.
Distinguishing features include large ocular cavities
oblique cranium-- indicates subject is not human.
Could you point that flash away from me?
If it's not human, what is it?
It's mammalian.
My guest is, It's a chimpanzee or something from the ape family
possibly an orangutan.
Buried in the city cemetery in Ray Soame's grave?
Try telling that to the good townsfolk
or to Ray Soame's family.
I want tissue samples and X rays, blood typing, toxicology
and a full genetic work-up.
What we can't do here, we'll order to go.
You don't honestly believe this is some kind of an extraterrestrial?
This is somebody's sick joke.
Is there any reason we can't do those X rays right now?
I'm not crazy, Scully.
I have the same doubts you do.
confirms homologous, but possibly mutated,
mammalian physiology.
However, does not account for small, unidentified object
found in subject's nasal cavity.
A grey, metallic implant forming...
Who is it?
Steven Spielberg.
I'm going for a run.
Want to come?
Pass.
Figure out what that little thing is?
No. And I'm not
losing any sleep over it.
Good night.
Ray Soames was a patient of mine.
I oversaw his treatment for over a year
for clinical schizophrenia.
Ray had an inability to grasp reality.
he seemed to suffer from some kind of post-traumatic stress.
Is that something you've seen before?
I've treated similar cases.
Were any of those Ray Soames' classmates?
Yes.
We're trying to find a connection in these deaths.
Did you treat any of these kids with hypnosis?
No. l did not.
Are you treating any of these kids now?
Currently?
Yes, I'm treating Billy Miles and Peggy O'Dell.
They're here at this hospital?
Going on four years now.
Would it be possible to talk to them?
Well, you might find it difficult.
Certainly in Billy Miles' case.
Billy's experiencing what we call a waking coma.
Functionally, his brain waves are flat.
How did it happen?
He and Peggy were involved in an automobile accident.
Doctor: Peggy?
We have some visitors.
Would you talk with them?
Billy wants me to read now.
Does he like it when you read to him?
Yes.
Billy needs me close.
Doctor
l'm wondering if we can do a cursory medical exam
on Peggy?
Peggy, what are you doing?
Doctor: No one will hurt you.
Doctor: Get an orderly!
Get an orderly! Nobody's going to hurt you.
Stop it!
It's all right.
Nurse: Honey, you're going to be fine.
Calm down.
You know that you will be all right.
Billy said he was sorry
he didn't get to say good-bye.
How did you know she would have the marks?
I don't know. Lucky guess?
Damn it, Mulder, cut the crap.
What is going on here?
What do you know about those marks?
I don't think you're ready for what I think.
I'm here to solve this case.
I want the truth.
I think those kids have been abducted.
By who?
By what.
You don't really believe that.
Do you have a better explanation?
I'll buy that girl is suffering
some kind of pronounced psychosis.
Whether it's organic or the result of those marks
I can't say
but to say that they've been riding around in fying saucers--
there is nothing to support that.
Nothing scientific, you mean.
There has got to be an explanation.
You've got four victims--
all of them died in or near the woods.
They found Karen Swenson's body in the forest in her pajamas
ten miles from her house.
How did she get there?
What were those kids doing out there in the forest?
Mulder?
Mulder, is that you?
Mulder?
Special Agent Dana Scully, F.B.I. Drop your weapon.
I'm with the County Sheriffs Department.
You're trespassing on private property here.
We are conducting
an investigation.
Get in your car and leave
or I'll have to arrest you.
I don't care who you are.
This is a crime scene.
Did you hear what I said?
You are on private property without legal permission.
Now, I'm only going to say it one more time.
Get in your car and leave!
What's he doing out here all by himself?
Maybe it has something to do with this.
What do you think it is?
I don't know.
Is it a campfire?
It was all over the ground.
I think something's going on out here.
Some kind
of a sacrifice, maybe.
What if these kids are involved
in some kind of a cult
and that man knows something about it?
I want to come back here.
You okay, Mulder?
Yeah. I'm just, uh...
What are you looking for?
What happened?
We lost power.
Brakes, steering, everything.
We lost nine minutes.
Whoo!
We lost what?
Nine minutes!
I looked at my watch just before the flash
and it was 9:03.
It just turned 9:13.
Look.
Look!
Oh, yes!
Abductees.
People that have made U.F.O. sightings.
They've reported unexplained time loss.
Come on.
Gone!
just like that.
No, wait a minute.
You're saying that... that time disappeared.
Time can't just disappear.
It's a universal invariant.
Not in this zip code.
Great.
Hi.
I want you to look at something.
Come on in.
What are they?
Mulder, what are they?!
Mosquito bites.
Are you sure?
Yeah. l got eaten up a lot myself out there.
You okay?
Yes.
You're shaking.
I need to sit down.
Take your time.
I was 12 when it happened.
My sister was eight.
She just disappeared out of her bed one night.
just gone. Vanished.
No note, no phone calls, no evidence of anything.
You never found her.
It tore the family apart.
No one would talk about it.
There were no facts to confront
nothing to offer any hope.
What did you do?
Eventually, I went off to school in England.
I came back, got recruited by the Bureau.
Seems I had a natural aptitude
for applying behavioral models to criminal cases.
My success allowed me a certain freedom
to pursue my own interests
and that's when I came across the <font color="#00FF00">X-Files</font>.
By accident?
At first, it looked
like a garbage dump
for U.F.O. sightings, alien abduction reports.
The kind of stuff that most people laugh at as being ridiculous.
But I was fascinated.
I read all the cases I could get my hands on. Hundreds of them.
I read everything I could about paranormal phenomenon
about the occult and...
What?
There's classified government information
I've been trying to access
but someone has been blocking my attempts to get at it.
Who? I don't understand.
Someone at a higher level of power.
The only reason
I've been allowed to continue is because I've made
connections in Congress.
They're afraid of what?
That you'll leak this information?
You're part of that agenda, you know that.
I'm not a part of any agenda.
You've got to trust me.
I'm here just like you-- to solve this.
I'm telling you this, Scully, because you need to know
because of what you've seen.
In my research I've worked very closely with a man
named Dr. Heinz Werber.
He's taken me through deep hypnosis.
I've been able to go into my own repressed memories
to the night my sister disappeared.
I can recall a bright light outside
and a presence in the room.
I was paralyzed
unable to respond to my sister's calls for help.
Listen to me, Scully.
This thing exists.
How do you know?
The government knows about it
and I got to know what they're protecting.
Nothing else matters to me
and this is as close as I've ever gotten to it.
Hello?
What?
Who is this?
Who is th..?
That was some woman
and she said Peggy O'Dell was dead.
The girl in the wheelchair?
Man: Yeah, I'll bring it over in a minute.
What happened?
She ran right out in front of me.
Who are you?
She was running?
On foot?
Well, that's just...
Let's go. Let's go.
Someone trashed the lab and stole the body.
We're going back to the motel.
What?! They stole the corpse?
F.B.I.
There goes my computer.
Damn it! The X rays and pictures!
Man: l need a couple of men out here.
We'll need a light safety curtain.
My name is Theresa Nemman.
You've got to protect me.
Come with us.
This is the way it happens.
I don't know how I get out there.
I'll just find myself out in the woods.
How long has it been happening?
Ever since the summer we graduated.
It's happened to my friends too.
That's why I need you to protect me.
I'm scared I might die
like the others.
Like... Peggy did tonight.
Your father's the medical examiner.
You were the one
on the phone.
You told me
Peggy O'Dell had been killed.
Theresa, your father knows about this, doesn't he?
About what happens?
Yes.
But he said never to tell
anyone about any of it.
Why?
He wants to protect me.
He thinks he can protect me, but l don't think he can.
Do you have the marks, Theresa?
Yes.
I'm going to die, aren't I?
I'm going to be next.
No, you're not going to die.
Oh, God.
Let's go home, Theresa.
Theresa, come on.
Come on, honey.
I don't think she wants to leave.
I don't care what you think.
She's a sick girl.
Your father wants to take you home.
He'll get you cleaned up.
Going to take you where you'll be safe, Theresa.
Detective Miles and I won't let anything happen to you.
You're Billy Miles' father?
That's right, and you stay away from that boy.
You got to love this place.
Every day is like Halloween.
They know, Mulder.
They know who's responsible for the murders.
They know something.
Dr. Nemman's been hiding medical evidence
from the beginning.
He lied on the autopsy reports.
Now we find out about the detective.
Who would have reason to trash the lab and our rooms?
Why would they destroy evidence?
What would they want with that corpse?
I don't know.
Makes you wonder what's in those other two graves.
They're both empty.
What is going on here?
I think I know who did it.
I think I know who killed Karen Swenson.
Who?
The detective?
The detective's son.
Billy Miles.
The boy in the hospital?
The vegetable?
Billy Miles?
A boy in a coma for the last four years
dug up these graves?
Peggy O'Dell was bound to a wheelchair
but ran in front of that truck.
I'm not making this up.
It fits the profile of alien abduction.
This fits a profile?
Peggy O'Dell was killed at 9:00.
That's right around the time we lost nine minutes.
Something happened in that nine minutes.
Time as we know it stopped
and something took control over it.
You think I'm crazy.
What?
Peggy O'Dell's watch stopped a couple of minutes after nine.
I made a note of it when I saw the body.
The kids come to the forest because the forest controls them
and the marks are from some kind oftests
that's being done on them
and that maybe causes some kind of genetic mutation
which would explain the body that we dug up.
And the force summoned Theresa Nemman's body
into the woods tonight.
Yes, but it was Billy Miles who took her there.
Summoned by some alien impulse.
That's it.
Come on.
Let's get out ofhere.
Where are we going?
To pay a visit to Billy Miles.
Nurse: Now, we could stand here until the Second Coming
waiting for Billy to get out of this bed.
It ain't going to happen.
He blinks and I know about it.
I guess you changed his bedpan last night.
Nobody else here's going to do it.
You noticed nothing unusual?
Do you remember what you were doing last night
around 9:00?
Probably watching TV.
Yeah.
Do you remember what you were watching?
Um, let's see...
You know, I don't really remember what I watched.
Miss...
What is she looking for?
Mulder, take a look at this.
You know who was taking care of Peggy O'Dell last night?
Not me.
It's not my ward, not my aisle of the produce section.
I do have a job of my own to do.
What is she doing now?
Thank you for your time, ma'am.
Okay.
Good day.
That kid may have killed Peggy O'Dell.
I don't believe this.
It's crazy.
He was in the woods.
You're sure?
This is the same stuff I took a handful of
in the forest.
Maybe we should run a lab test...
We lost the original sample in the fire.
I want you to understand what it is you're saying.
You said it yourself!.
Yeah, but you have to write it down
in your report.
You're right.
We'll take another sample from the forest
and run a comparison before we do anything.
The detective's here.
What do you think?
You wouldn't listen to me.
I told you to stay out of this.
Hold it. Hold it right there!
You got no business out here.
There were screams.
Down on the ground.
Now!
You know it's Billy.
You've known it all along.
I said down on the ground.
How long are you going to let it happen?
He's going to kill her.
Billy!
No!
Let her go.
Leave her alone.
Dad?
Billy.
Oh, God.
Scully.
Scully!
Mulder, what happened?
There was a light.
It was incredible.
If you can hear me, raise your right hand.
Tell me about the light, Billy.
When did you first see the light?
In the forest.
We were all in the forest having a party.
All my friends.
We were celebrating.
What were you celebrating?
Graduation.
And then the light came.
It took me away to the testing place.
They would tell me to gather the others
so that they could do tests.
They put something in my head.
Here.
Billy: I would wait for their orders.
Man: Billy, who gave the orders?
Billy: The light. They said it would be okay.
No one would know. But the test didn't work.
They wanted everything destroyed.
They said they were leaving.
I'm afraid.
I'm afraid they're coming back.
Don't be afraid, Billy.
What we've just witnessed
what we've read in your field reports
the scientific basis and credibility
just seem wholly insupportable.
You're aware of that?
Yes, sir.
My reports are personal and subjective.
I haven't gone so far as to draw any conclusion about what l've seen.
Or haven't seen, as seems to be the case.
This, uh... time loss
you did or did not experience it?
I can't substantiate it, no.
What exactly can you substantiate?
I see no evidence
that justifies these investigations.
There were, of course, crimes committed.
Yes, but how do you prosecute a case like this?
With testimony given under hypnosis
from a boy who claims he was given orders
from some alien force
through an implant
in his nose.
You have no physical evidence.
This is the object
described by Billy Miles
as a communication device.
I removed it
from the exhumed body.
I kept it in my pocket.
It was the only evidence not destroyed in the fire.
I ran a lab test on it.
The material could not be identified.
Agent Mulder-- what are his thoughts?
Agent Mulder believes we are not alone.
Thank you, Agent Scully.
That will be all.
Hello.
Mulder: Scully, it's me. I haven't been able to sleep.
I talked to the D.A.'s Office in Raymond County, Oregon.
There's no case file on Billy Miles.
The paperwork we filed is gone.
We need to talk, Scully.
Y-Yes.
Tomorrow.

two miles west of the Canyon Ridge intersection.
Suggest we dispatch fire crews. Over.
This is Deputy Wright.
Do you copy?
Son of a...
Sir?
Sorry to disturb you, sir,
but we've picked up an unidentified bogey.
I think you should see the replay for yourself.
It tripped the fence at 2317,
off the coast of Connecticut, sir.
Initial trajectory was north by northwest.
Then it started going crazy.
What about other aircraft in the area, or missile testing?
Sir, no known aircraft can maneuver like this.
Well, whatever it was,
it dropped off the screen at 2418, sir.
Hit ground just west of Lake Michigan,
outside Townsend, Wisconsin.
The tracking and impact prediction team
calculated impact at over 800 miles per hour.
I've instructed Chief Koretz
to start her report right away.
What she tracked
was a meteor-- its aberrant movement
was obviously due to instrument malfunction.
But, sir...
Your report will reflect these facts.
Is that clear?
Yes, sir.
Good.
Code Indigo Delta Echo Niner.
I have a confirmed Fallen Angel in Sector 87.
Mobilize Operation Falcon immediately.
Hello?
They will have no comment
until the government investigation, now underway,
is completed.
Government officials remain vague
about the toxic cargo that has caused the immediate evacuation
of Townsend, Wisconsin's 12,000 residents.
Speculation here has centered on a shipment of toxic waste...
Then what happened out there, if it wasn't a train wreck?
Mr. Mulder, the continental United States is surrounded
by an electronic fence that reaches 15,000 miles
into space.
We use it to track and monitor
the 7,087 man-made objects that orbit the Earth.
Last night, at 2317, that fence was breached.
This morning, at 0100,
Operation Falcon went into effect,
led by Colonel Calvin Henderson
the Air Force's reclamations expert.
Reclamations?
During the Cold War, his job
was to prevent technologies from downed U.S. aircraft
from getting into Soviet hands.
He's part of a crash retrieval unit.
Mm.
Quick response.
I'd say you have...
24 hours
before the entire area is sanitized.
After that, it would be like nothing ever happened.
Thank you, sir! Thank you.
Let's get 'er going! Let's go, let's go!
All right, let's move out!
The second roadblock needs to be in place and operational!
All right! I'll get right on it, sir!
All right, clear the road!
Got another one coming in!
Carter!
You're late, Lieutenant.
It's gonna be dark in a half hour.
We had a flat outside the perimeter, sir.
There's a general briefing at 2200 hours.
We first go to headquarters for live rounds.
Live rounds, sir?
You got a problem with that?
No, sir! We were told this was just a drill.
They told you wrong.
Sir.
Okay, everyone out!
Come on, people, light a fire!
Prepare your targets, Lincoln.
You just made the worst mistake
of your life, Agent Mulder.
I think you knocked out a filling.
I'll see to it that you pay the price
for putting my men at risk.
Since when does taking pictures put anyone's life at risk?
You violated a U.S. Government quarantine
and that's a Federal crime.
That's a quarantine?
Is that what you call this?
We're trying to contain an ecological disaster.
That's a lot of firepower just to protect Mother Nature.
I have my orders
and the license to execute them as I see fit.
I suggest you forget what you saw
or what you think you saw...
for your own well-being.
You've got a downed craft in those woods, sir,
and troops carrying live rounds.
We both know what's out there!
Come on, move it.
That's right, buddy, get going.
Get in there.
You MUFON or CUFOS?
Do you mind if I sit down?
Uh, let me guess.
You're with that new group, CSICOP, right?
Um, say no more. You're a cautious man.
Trust no one-- very wise.
After what happened to JFK, I understand completely.
Oh, let me introduce myself.
My name is Max Fenig.
I'm with the National Investigative Committee
of Aerial Phenomenon.
NICAP.
Uh, pleased... pleased to
make your acquaintance.
I, uh, wish we could shake on it, you know.
Firm grip, look right in the eye--
you learn a lot about a guy that way.
Can I, um...
Can I ask you a question?
Go ahead.
Did you see anything?
Did you get close?
Me, I saw nothing.
I didn't see anything!
Nada, zip.
A hundred yards past the roadblock
they nailed me.
Have no idea how they did it.
I'm telling you,
it's like the Roswell cover-up all over again.
What makes you so sure there's something out there?
Same thing that makes you so sure?
I didn't order room service.
This isn't funny, Mulder.
Did you meet Max?
Who?
Max from NICAP.
Oh. They must have released him.
Another intrepid soul in search of a close encounter.
Is that what this is about?
What else?
Try explaining that to Section Chief McGrath.
He stepped over Blevins, ordering a full inquiry
with a recommendation...
Mulder, he wants to shut down the X-Files
and he wants you out of the Bureau.
What else is new?
I don't understand you, Mulder--
why you're always defying protocol,
ignoring jurisdiction.
Because I know what I saw, Scully.
There weren't train tracks anywhere near that site,
so how could it have been a derailed container?
Because it wasn't.
What you saw was not a toxic spill.
But it wasn't a UFO, either.
Okay, I'm all ears. What was it?
It was a downed Libyan jet with a nuclear warhead.
Over U.S. airspace?
They've been picking up low-grade levels of radiation
indicating that the plutonium casing
may have cracked.
So to avoid mass panic...
You really believe that story?
That story happens to be highly classified.
A highly classified lie.
They're searching for someone, Scully.
If they're searching for anyone, it's probably the pilot.
Oh, you think they'd roll out all this material
for one Libyan fighter jock?
Besides, no human pilot
walked away from the wreckage I saw.
Well, maybe he ejected.
Maybe.
You can't be serious.
As long as we're here
in beautiful downtown Townsend, why not?
Mulder, the hearing is tomorrow morning at 10:00.
That gives us 24 hours to investigate.
My assignment is to bring you back--
not to help you dig yourself in deeper.
The Last Detail, starring Dana Scully.
What's going on?
Looks like housekeeping hasn't been here yet.
Who would...?
Max?
Get your hands up!
Whoa, whoa, don't shoot! Don't shoot!
Max?
My apologies.
Forgive me, please.
I'm a curious man.
I had to know.
Know what?
If it was really you.
But you don't know me.
Last night was the first time we laid eyes on each other.
Not true-- we at NICAP
have been following your career really closely
ever since you became involved with X-Files.
Following my career? How?
The Freedom of Information Act.
Your travel expenses are a matter of public record.
So this must be the enigmatic Agent Scully.
How did you recognize me?
Well, I, uh, I saw your picture
in a trade publication once
and of course I read your article in Omni
about the Gulf Breeze sightings.
I published that under a pseudonym.
M.F. Luder. I know.
M.F. Luder is an anagram for F. Mulder.
You really didn't think
that would fool us, did you?
I didn't think anybody was paying attention.
Somebody is always paying attention, Mr. Mulder.
Amazing.
Amazing? Hardly.
Hey, you want to see something amazing, come with me.
Enigmatic Dr. Scully.
This is my, uh...
Right this way.
Excuse the mess.
Okay.
Where's those, uh...
I'm gonna turn this off.
They were right here.
Oh, here they are.
Latest crop circle photos from Project Argus. Huh?
Your opinion-- fact or fraud?
Fraud.
How do you explain
the anomalous blisters on the plants?
Well, it's either some unreported
weathering effect common to wheat,
or a systematic reaction by the plant tissue
to being lodged in one position.
I see you've read the literature.
I try to keep up.
And what about the ones-- Max...
you said you had something to show us.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
The Wolf's Ear 2000.
You ever hear of this?
Yeah. Wolf Industries supplies the CIA
with all of its surveillance equipment.
State-of-the-art search and intercept--
up to 100 channels per second.
Currently, I'm jacked into local fire and police departments,
cellular phone pathways,
and when the weather's right,
sometimes even air traffic control
from Whitmarsh Air Force Base.
What have you got, Max?
Mobile unit broadcast in scan mode--
Townsend Sheriff's Department, two nights ago.
We got a fire off County Road D-7,
two miles west of the Canyon Ridge intersection.
Suggest we dispatch fire crews. Over.
This is Deputy Wright.
Do you copy?
And then this, 35 minutes later,
presumably from the fire crew.
Reception got wiggy for some reason.
This is Unit 53.
Man down. Request medevac!
I said request medevac!
You're breaking up!
Barely... bad... very bad.
Wait a second.
What the hell?
Charlie, we got a situation here!
We put up a tight net.
Yes, sir, every inch of ground is being covered
dug up, squeezed, and sifted.
No, sir. It will not get away.
Not this time.
Mrs. Wright?
Hi, I'm Fox Mulder, this is Dana Scully.
We're from the FBI.
We'd like to ask you a few questions about your husband.
He's dead.
What else is there to know?
I'm sorry about your husband.
Oh, please.
Mrs. Wright, we want to help you.
Then leave me alone.
Why won't you let us help you?
I don't know anything.
Don't you understand?
They won't even release the body
so I can give him a proper burial, okay?
The government can't do that.
I'm sure if we appealed to...
No!
You can't.
You're entitled to the truth.
I can't afford the truth.
They said, if I spoke to anyone,
they would withhold my husband's pension,
and I have a child to take care of.
Picking up an extremely high frequency signal--
200,000 megahertz.
Sir, target on the northeast side.
Foot speed--
seven miles per hour, sir.
Beta team...
Copy.
Target entering your section from the southwest.
Search and destroy.
Repeat-- search and destroy.
Yes, sir.
Jackson?
Nothing.
Must have been an animal.
I'm sorry, but unless you have a subpoena,
I can't discuss patient information.
Does that mean that Jason Wright was your patient?
It means I have nothing more to say about this.
What about to his wife and child, Doctor?
Would you have anything to say to them?
Because whoever got to you also got to her.
They must have made some pretty big threats.
What'd they hold over your head--
your medical license, the IRS?
I hate fascists.
Excuse me?
The men who came in here--
the way they pushed us all around.
Dr. Oppenheim, tell us about the deputy.
You saw him that night, didn't you?
Yes, and three others from a fire crew.
They were all DOA with fifth- and sixth-degree burns
over 90% of their bodies,
but they weren't like any burns I've ever seen,
and they took the bodies away
before we could perform any pathology.
Did you note any cadaveric heat rigor
or heat stiffening?
Yes, actually, there was quite a bit of flexion in the limbs.
How do you know so much about it?
I did my residency in forensic medicine, so...
Dr. Oppenheim, in your opinion,
could those burns have been caused by ionizing radiation?
Well, I hadn't thought.
I suppose it's possible
if the exposure was sufficiently intense.
Code five. All available teams...
Let's say those men died from radiation exposure.
Couldn't it have been from the cracked core
of a nuclear warhead?
I've read about these kinds of burns, Scully.
Yeah, so have I-- in Hiroshima at ground zero.
I'm talking about close encounter mortalities.
I have a stack of X-Files reporting the same results.
Mulder, I don't claim to know all the answers,
but if we don't make the OPR inquest by tomorrow morning,
there may not be any more X-Files.
Come on, man, hold on, hold on.
Start an I.V. here, stat.
Tell us what happened out there.
Whatever happened, Mulder, it has nothing to do with you.
Wrong, Colonel.
We both want the same thing, only you want it dead.
Can't you see that by chasing it down like an animal,
you leave it no choice but to defend itself?
How many more people have to die
before you rethink your approach?
Listen to me
'cause I'm not wasting another breath on this.
If you and your partner
aren't out of here in 30 seconds...
Agent Scully stays right here.
We're undermanned, she's a medical doctor-- she stays.
If that's okay with you.
Of course.
Doctor, if you don't mind,
you just take care of my men and let me do my work, okay?
Outside this emergency room, you can do whatever you want,
but in here I call the shots--
assuming, of course,
you want me to take care of your men.
Get this man out of my sight.
Yes, sir.
Where do I scrub up?
Max.
Hey, Max.
Max.
Hey... Max.
Who are... who are you?
Max, it's me, Fox Mulder.
You okay?
What are you doing here?
You were having some kind of seizure.
Seizure?
That's impossible.
You were lying on the floor unconscious, convulsing.
That's odd.
I haven't had an episode in seven years--
not since I went on medication.
Let's get you to the hospital.
No.
I mean, I mean, it's not necessary.
You sure?
Yeah, I lived with epilepsy all my life.
I'm not in any danger.
Yeah, it started in South Dakota
when I was ten.
The doctor said I must have incurred a head injury.
I don't remember ever hitting my head.
When you have a seizure, you have no memory of it?
When I was a kid, I used to wake up in strange places
with no idea where I was or how I got there.
Sorry, I... I got to, I got to go to sleep.
All right.
Rough night, huh?
It was terrible.
We lost all but two
and they're still in critical condition
on their way to the burn unit
at Johns Hopkins.
So, what do you think, Scully?
What's going on out there?
I don't know, and under other circumstances
I would like to find out,
but we have a plane to catch in just over an hour.
I want you to take a look at something first.
What?
Max.
There's an unusual incision behind his left ear.
I've seen this incision twice before.
Two women-- a thousand miles apart,
no way of knowing each other, no relation.
Both claim to have been abducted by aliens.
Are you saying Max Fenig is an abductee?
Mulder,
the man is taking powerful antipsychotic drugs.
I saw them in his RV.
They're for his epilepsy.
Not all of them.
Dilantin is an anticonvulsant,
but Mellaril is used exclusively to treat schizophrenia.
More than likely, Max is delusional.
You don't seem to understand, Scully.
Max doesn't believe he was abducted by aliens.
I believe he was.
Now, could you at least take a look at the scar
and give me your medical opinion?
Okay.
You pack.
I'll take a look at Max on the way to the airport.
Sir, I have flash traffic at 24-18.
Repeated calls for I.D. go unanswered,
and it's not in the orbital or suborbital inventory.
24-18-- isn't that where...?
Same exact spot, sir,
though I am reading a much larger craft this time.
Meteor, Ms. Koretz.
A much larger meteor, sir.
Hold on a second.
We have a confirm.
Whitmarsh Air Force Base is tracking.
Where is it?
Well, sir, the meteor seems to be hovering
over a small town in Eastern Wisconsin.
Come on, Mulder, let's get this over with.
Hey, Max.
Mulder, look at this.
What is that? Blood?
Falcon Patrol reporting unidentified trespass.
Repeat: Falcon Patrol reporting
unidentified trespass at the waterfront-- dock seven.
Mulder!
Come on.
Where do you think you're going?
Look, if we go to the airport right now,
we might make the plane,
which would at least give you half a chance
of defending yourself.
Think about it, Scully, Max is a gypsy, a nomad, right?
Yeah, so what?
So he intercepted Deputy Wright's last call
to his dispatcher,
which means he was here in Townsend, Wisconsin
the night of the crash.
Of all the places he could have been, he was right here.
Don't you think that's more than a coincidence?
If Max was abducted, that would go a long way
to explaining his obsessions,
and if we figured that out, you can be sure
that Colonel Henderson has as well.
Do you have the keys?
Don't do this.
Sir, we've apprehended the target.
It's just a civilian.
Negative, Falcon Patrol.
Take him with extreme caution.
They're dead.
It hurts. Stop.
Why, why, why, why?
It hurts.
Max?
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts.
Stop it. It hurts. Max.
It hurts, stop it, it hurts.
It's all right.
Stop it!
It... hurts.
No, no, it's me they...
they're coming for me.
No, I know that...
That's why they're here. They're coming... for me.
It hurts.
Keep 'em out there.
Go, go, go!
Alpha team, secure the roof.
Hold it right there.
Put your hands up and come with us.
Alpha team, ready on the roof.
Roger, Alpha.
Delta team, report.
Delta team in position, sir.
What are you doing?
You have a very sick man in there.
We're not in the hospital now, Dr. Scully.
Omega team, report.
Omega team in position.
He's a delusional schizophrenic.
Keep her clear.
Sir, this is Alpha team leader.
I'm picking up three forms inside the structure.
Did you say three forms?
That's affirmative.
Two are proximate,
the third approaching from 40 meters.
All teams prepare for go in 30 seconds.
Come on. Come on, Max.
Why... stop. Why...
I'm here to help you.
I'm scared.
I know.
Don't let them take me.
I won't let them take you.
Come on, Max.
Come with me.
Sir, this is Alpha team leader.
Except for our men,
I'm only picking up one figure inside.
I do not copy that.
We indicate only one figure
inside the building.
What?
Blow the door.
Where is he?
He's gone.
They got to him first.
They beat us, Colonel.
Arrest him.
And keep looking.
Agent Scully,
to the best of your knowledge, was Agent Mulder ever assigned
to investigate matters related to the evacuation
of Townsend, Wisconsin?
No, sir.
At any time,
were you aware of his submitting a Form 302
requesting said assignment or travel expenses?
No, sir.
While in Wisconsin,
did Agent Mulder drive a blue Ford Taurus
registered to the state car rental agency?
Yes, sir.
Thank you, Agent Scully.
Sir, request permission to make a statement.
Request denied.
Sir, it's unfair to judge Mulder by the same criteria...
You're dismissed, Agent Scully.
But, sir, I...
That will be all.
You hear that noise, Scully?
Hammer and nails.
They're building a gallows in the town square.
Don't worry.
It was only a matter of time.
I'm surprised I lasted this long.
Good luck.
I'll break a leg.
As well as insubordination and misconduct.
How do you respond to these allegations, Agent Mulder?
Over a dozen men lost their lives,
and you want me to respond to issues of protocol?
You failed to obtain proper authorization for your actions.
Because I knew it wouldn't be forthcoming.
You also violated a federal quarantine...
A cover-up was underway.
...exposing yourself and possibly others
to toxic contamination!
Oh, toxic contamination-- are we back in that?
You read my report.
Explain the disappearance of Max Fenig.
Your report is not the subject of this inquiry.
I have further evidence to support my conclusions.
X rays taken while Mr. Fenig was institutionalized
show an object lodged in his cerebellum.
That is irrelevant, Agent Mulder.
The man was abducted.
We all know it, everybody in this room knows it.
Colonel Henderson's written testimony states
that Fenig's body was found two hours later
in a cargo container.
Then what can I say?
How can I disprove lies that are stamped
with an official seal?
That will be all, Mr. Mulder.
You can deny all the things I've seen,
all the things I've discovered, but not for much longer,
'cause too many others know what's happening out there,
and no one-- no government agency--
has jurisdiction over the truth.
Why did you countermand our decision?
Mulder's conduct was in clear violation
not only of Bureau procedures but of federal law.
Yes.
I don't understand.
The committee's case was airtight.
You've ruined the last best chance we had
to get rid of him.
I appreciate your frustration,
but you and I both know that Mulder's work--
his, uh... singular passion--
poses a most unique dilemma,
but his occasional insubordination
is in the end far less dangerous.
With respect, sir,
less dangerous than what?
Than having him exposed to the wrong people--
what he knows...
what he thinks he knows.
Always keep your friends close, Mr. McGrath.
But keep your enemies closer.

(loud rock music plays)
(inaudible conversation)
(inaudible conversation)
(amorous moaning)
(panting)
Oh!
God!
That was...
That was incredible.
I mean it.
(panting)
You don't believe me.
Can you hear me?
Hey, l...
I don't even knowyour name.
Oh...
New York businessman calls his wife to say good night.
Then picks up some chippy.
Brings her back for sex.
Beyond that, nothing makes sense.
How's that?
Security monitor records the victim
entering with a woman at 1 0:1 3.
The same monitor records a male
Ieavingjust after midnight.
Couldn't she have changed clothes?
Thought ofthat.
Male is definitely a different person--
Short hair and at least 30 pounds heavier.
No record ofhis entry
nor ofthe chippy leaving.
Scully: 30 foors up, no other egress.
Did the medical examiner establish a cause ofdeath?
Guy blew an artery.
Must have been some roll in the hay.
It's hard to imagine in this day and age
someone having sex with a perfect stranger.
Signs ofrobbery?
The male exited wearing
the victim's suit, carrying a suitcase
and the wallet's gone.
I don't even know whywe got this call.
Really.
Somebody at the Bureau
put out a memo requesting any case involving this C.O.D.
I assumed it was a...
Thanks for the call.
Five deaths, four in six weeks
between here and Boston.
In each case, the victim dies in the throes ofpassion.
Two women and three men, including the last one.
All young, healthy adults.
All with symptoms ofmassive coronary arrest.
A new drug on the streets?
The oldest drug-- not even illegal.
Each body showed huge amounts ofpheromones.
The chemicals animals secrete?
You mean sexual attractants.
Radar love-- a hundred times stronger
than found in nature.
Strong enough to produce
anaphylactic shock or a coronary.
Soyou think somebody is synthesizing them?
It's been done, but in nowhere near these concentrations
and, Scully, you're going to love this.
The pheromones we're talking about?
They contain human DNA.
Well, there's still a question
as to whether humans can produce pheromones
so how can that be?
I don't know, but ifit's true
this guy's a walking aphrodisiac.
He's the ultimate sex magnet.
He? Or she?
You've got victims ofboth sexes.
Both a man and a woman on the hotel security monitor.
That is a puzzle.
So what's our profile ofthe killer?
Indeterminate in height, weight, sex.
Unarmed, but extremely attractive.
It gets weirder.
There's been four deaths matching this M.O.
in the last six weeks.
In Boston, Hartford, Philadelphia
and here in Washington.
The killer's moving south.
There was a death I made a note ofabout a year ago
with the same symptoms.
A 32-year-old U.M.W. Iabor organizerwas found dead
outside a town called Steveston
in the woods of Massachusetts
home to a sect ofreligious isolationists
called the " Kindred."
Right. They live up there without electricity, phones
any modern amenities-- Iike the Amish.
The Kindred are known
for their handmade stoneware pottery.
They mine the clay.
What's so weird about that?
The white clay in those hills is particular to that region.
It's also the same substance
I scraped out ofthe scratches on the latest victim.
Wait. Aren't these people
famous for their abstinence and pure Christian ways?
Yes, but it looks as ifone ofthem forgot
to clean under his fingernails.
Hi.
This is Federal Agent Scully.
I'm Agent Mulder.
We're investigating a possible murder.
There aren't many killings around here.
What can you tell me about the Kindred?
They keep pretty much to themselves, huh?
Some folks say they're doing ceremonies--
voodoo or something.
I've got nothing against them myself.
They bring in the tourists.
They letyou take pictures?
Those are from back in the '30s.
What about the missing ones?
I'm having them reframed. They're under the counter.
Can I look at them?
Sure.
How would I get up to see them?
Well, they don't like strangers up there much.
The road's in pretty rough shape.
Steveston.
That's them now.
They usually shop at the feed store.
Whoa, boy.
Excuse me. Ladies.
I think I'm going to go inside.
You need anything from the feed store?
Hi.
She must have problems on the asphalt.
Has she ever thrown a shoe?
What's her name?
Alice.
That's sweet.
Did you name her?
We named her all together.
I'm not allowed to talk outside.
That's all right.
I'm Dana Scully.
I don't mean you any harm.
Scully, what areyou doing?
I wasjust talking.
You all right?
Yeah. I think so.
You want to sit down?
Interesting way oflife.
You get any sense about them?
There's something up there, Mulder.
I've been saying that foryears.
Oh, for a four-wheel drive.
Looks like about a mile walk.
Afteryou.
Now...
this... that's west.
What does the map say?
That we should be there already.
(sighs)
(stick breaking)
Mulder, look.
Hmm?
We're F.B.I. agents!
Federal police.
I'm Agent Mulder. This is Agent Scully.
We're investigating a murder.
I'm going to have to askyou
to remain at a distance.
Please, sir.
Man #1 : Yourweapons are forbidden here.
We can outlastyou at this spot.
You're not leaving until your guns
are handed to our council.
You will have them again as you leave.
We can't do that.
Woman: Please.
I'm SisterAbby. This is Brother Oakley.
We are all saddened
bywhat has happened in yourworld
but it does not concern us.
Up here, no one kills another, ever.
Wejust want to have a few questions answered.
Yourweapons are unwelcome here, notyou.
Come and praywith us. Be one ofus.
You'll see we harm no one.
Please relinquish yourweapons.
Please.
Now there is no reason to be afraid.
Come... sit.
Let us pray as one.
(man coughing)
SisterAbby: We who are separate give thanks
for our allotted time on this world.
We ask for strength
that we may bring forth the bounty that God
has provided.
Amen.
And we pray for the day ofthe coming
the moment ofour release.
All: Amen.
Let us eat.
I was wondering ifwe might ask a few questions.
We're looking for someone who may have come from here.
We have pictures.
We don't allow pictures.
A crime has been committed.
We have questions we need answered
ifyou'll forgive us.
What are these pictures?
Hotel securityvideos ofa man and a woman
who may have committed a murder.
Where was it committed?
In a hotel in Washington, D.C.
Mulder: lfyou look at the videotape
maybeyou can identify the individual.
How much violence has this person caused in yourworld?
Five murders so far.
And may kill again, which is whywe need your help.
Has anyone left recently?
(hand slapping table)
Yourworld does not interest us.
We have no need for yourviolence oryour questions.
I've said what is needed.
They have no right to be here at this time.
BrotherWilton, stand.
Before we can accept any man's person
we must accept our own.
And I askwho can stand in your sight
when onceyou are angry?
I am ashamed to lift up my face
and I shall not be ashamed in this evil time.
Make atonements for this wrath, BrotherWilton.
That's all right.
We didn't take any offense.
Anger, as violence, is not tolerated.
Our brother must be admonished.
(choking)
He can't breathe.
He does not need your help.
He's choking to death!
Remove BrotherAaron from the dining hall.
We did not inviteyou here to interfere.
We take care ofour own.
(rock music blaring)
Would you like to dance?
Not right now.
I'm really not interested, okay?
just one dance.
Yeah.
One dance.
It's a mile toyour car.
Stay on the path.
Thanks foryour cooperation.
Mulder: The Addams family finds religion.
Scully: Take me back to the 20th century.
You believe all that back there, Scully?
Believe all what?
All that "we take care ofour own" business?
They better, or that man at the dinner table is a dead man.
I think it was all an elaborate act.
What, the choking?
No. All this simple life crap.
These people know something.
You can see it in their eyes--
The way they look at one another.
Do they know who the murderer is?
They didn't answer a single question
and that outburst was right on cue.
Somehow we answered their questions.
Whyweren't there any children?
I know. That was odd.
You know what's really odd?
You know those pictures we saw in Steveston today
the ones from the '30s?
I saw some ofthose same faces at dinner tonight.
They've probably been intermarrying foryears.
Maybe.
Maybe not everything
is as black and white as it appears.
What areyou doing?
I'm going to go back for a little look-see.
Mulder: Maybe theywent to the movies.
(distant chanting)
You hear that?
Uh-huh.
(horse whinnies)
(horse whinnies)
What doyou think?
I think I want to see what's in that cellar.
Come with me.
I can giveyou information.
(chanting)
I know who did it.
The murders?
You've heard our prayers.
You've seen how we live our beliefs.
I wantyou to find this killer.
I wantyou to find him for me.
He was my best friend.
What's his name?
Brother Martin.
I called him Marty.
Martywas different.
What doyou mean, different?
How does he kill?
We're not sure.
All ofthe victims died ofcardiac arrest.
He poisons them, doesn't he?
Maybe. How doyou know that?
I need to showyou something.
Something about Marty.
We found them out on Route 44. We were wandering.
Marty and I used to do that.
Explore the edges ofourworld.
Somebody must have left them for garbage.
They are garbage.
Why did you keep them?
It was Martin who kept them.
Some ofwhat I saw in the magazines--
Some ofit was beautiful
but most ofit I didn't like.
It was garish, but Martin... Marty
he couldn't get enough.
He liked even the paper it was printed on. Slick.
Martywas captured byyourworld.
He left us to become one ofyou.
(clattering)
BrotherWilton.
- The woman has returned. - Where is she?
With Andrew in the main house.
The other one?
He's missing.
Come.
You said Martywas different.
Yes.
How?
How did he kill his victims?
I could be banished.
Does it have something to do with the ceremony in the barn tonight?
What areyou doing?
(whispering:) Scully.
Marty is different.
We're all different.
Oh.
No.
No.
Scully?
Get offofher!
I asked you not to interfere.
What wereyou doing back there?
I don't know.
- You don't know?! - No.
(retching)
Areyou all right?
(rock music playing)
I wasn't ignoring you.
No. Ofcourse I sawyou.
I just...
I didn't recognizeyou.
That's all.
Excuse me.
I'm having a conversation.
Sorry. No.
Uh-huh.
Thanks.
Howyou feeling?
Better.
A little embarrassed, actually.
Why? You don't remember any ofit.
It's like I don't remember...
Why didn'tyou get out before he..?
He told me he knew who the killerwas.
How did you know he wasn't the killer?
I believed him.
So what did you see down in the cellar?
just BrotherWhat's-his-name buried in some gopher hole
in the wall. Buried alive.
How doyou know he was alive?
I was in there with him
and his face was different.
Even his hairwas almost feminine.
Like he was going through some kind ofa transformation.
Changing sexes?
That would explain the hotel securityvideo.
Soyou're saying these people...
I know what I saw, Scully
and I sawyou about to do the wild thing
with some stranger.
Think he was trying to kill me?
(sighing)
Maybe it's the sex that kills.
Ifhe was trying to kill me, why did they let us go?
I don't know.
(laughing)
(knocking)
All right, let's break it up.
(groaning)
Out ofthe car.
Sorry, Officer.
You too. You a pro?
Pro?
(groaning)
What?
(gasping)
(gasping, coughing)
On a scale ofone to ten, she was a... kind three.
But there was something about her.
Did she touch you
or make any other physical contact?
Her touch was... electric.
But after that I remember... onlyvaguely.
What doyou remember?
Nothing, actually.
Try to remember, Michael.
The policeman at the scene supports whatyou said.
But maybe there was something unusual about this woman...
something you wouldn't feel comfortable
telling the police on the record.
- This is offthe record? - Absolutely.
What did you see, Michael?
After she left the car...
and she was fighting with the cop
I saw her in her clothes and she looked like a...
(nervous laugh)
She looked like a man.
She was a man?
The club scene used to be so simple.
It's offthe record.
Scout's honor.
Scully: We can't rule out
that we're looking for a transvestite.
I think DonJuan there knows the difference
between males and females.
I don't want us to ignore the obvious.
How else could a woman overpower a 200-pound cop?
She was a he.
Woman: Agent Mulder. Agent Scully.
The credit card stolen from the last victim in D.C.
wasjust used to order take-out in a hotel eight blocks away.
Marty (Woman): It was always forbidden.
But after the first time, I couldn't help myself.
Touching a human man or a woman...
is as powerful for me as it was foryou.
This is Agent Scully requesting police backup
and additional agents
at 771 Catherine Street-- the Hotel Catherine.
Yourworld offers pleasures...
pleasures we don't know because we're different.
Butyou know that now.
The others will punish me forwhat I've done.
They'll find me because the day is coming
and theywon't leave without me.
ScullyWhispers: Mulder.
(knocking on door)
Delivery.
F.B.I.!
F.B.I.! Clear!
Stay down!
Dead body!
(groans)
Scully?
Scully: I'm okay.
(breathing hard)
(whimpers)
Scully, down the stairs.
Federal agent! I'm armed!
Back away!
Step away!
Step away.
Please... don't hurt him.
No. Step away.
I'm armed.
Mulder: Scully!
The surrounding ten blocks
have been secured for the past hour.
We set up roadblocks
on all the routes out to Steveston.
No reports ofthem.
There's no way they could have gotten through.
What ifthey did get through?
There's only one place they'd hide.
They're gone.
We found something in the hay field.
Scully: I don't understand.
How can theyjust disappear?
They have no means oftransportation.
No earthly means oftransportation.
I made this.

ï»¿1 Oh, my... God.
That was...
that was incredible.
I mean it.
You don't believe me.
Can you hear me?
Hey, I...
I don't even know your name.
New York businessman calls his wife to say good night,
then goes out, picks up some chippie,
brings her back here for sex.
Beyond that, well, nothing makes a whole lot of sense.
How's that?
Security monitor records the victim
entering the room with a woman at 10:13.
Same monitor records a male leaving just after midnight.
Couldn't she have changed clothes?
Thought of that. Male is definitely a different person--
short hair and at least 30 pounds heavier.
The video never recorded his entry
nor the chippie ever leaving.
Well, we're 30 floors up.
No other means of egress.
Did the medical examiner establish a cause of death?
Guy blew an artery.
Must have been some roll in the hay.
It's hard to imagine, in this day and age,
someone having sex with a perfect stranger.
Any sign of robbery?
The male exited wearing
the victim's suit, carrying a suitcase,
and the wallet's gone.
You know, I don't even know why we got this call.
Really?
Somebody at the Bureau put out a memo
requesting any case involving this exact C.O.D.
I assumed it was a...
Thanks for the call.
Five deaths, four in the last six weeks
between here and Boston.
In each case the victim dies in the throes of passion.
Two women and three men, including the last one.
All young, healthy adults.
All with symptoms of massive coronary arrest.
You think there's a new drug on the streets?
The oldest drug-- not even illegal.
Each body showed the presence of huge amounts of pheromones.
The chemicals animals secrete?
You mean sexual attractants?
Radar love, only about a hundred times stronger
than found anywhere in nature.
Strong enough to produce
anaphylactic shock or a coronary.
So you think somebody is synthesizing them?
It's been done, but in nowhere near these concentrations,
and hold on to your hat, Scully,
'cause you're going to love this.
The pheromones we're talking about?
They contain human DNA.
Well, there's still a question
as to whether humans can produce pheromones,
so how can that be?
I don't know, but if it's true,
this guy's a walking aphrodisiac.
He's the ultimate sex magnet.
He or she?
You've got victims of both sexes.
Both a man and a woman on the hotel security monitor.
I know, that is a puzzle.
So, what is our profile of the killer?
Indeterminate in height, weight, sex.
Unarmed but extremely attractive.
It gets weirder.
As I said, there's been four deaths matching this M.O.
in the last six weeks.
In Boston, Hartford, Philadelphia,
and here in Washington.
The killer's moving south.
There was a death I made a note of about a year ago
with the same symptoms.
A 32-year-old U.M.W. labor organizer
was found dead outside a town called Steveston
in the woods of Massachusetts,
home to a sect of religious isolationists
called the Kindred.
Right. They live up there without electricity, phones,
any modern amenities-- a lot like the Amish.
The Kindred are known
for their handmade stoneware pottery.
They mine the clay themselves in the local hills.
What's so weird about that?
The white clay in those hills is particular to that region.
It's also the same substance
I scraped out of the scratches on the latest victim's side.
Wait a minute. Aren't these people famous
for their abstinence and their pure Christian ways?
Yes, but it looks as if one of them may have forgotten
to clean under his fingernails.
I'll meet you at the market.
Hi.
Excuse me, ma'am, this is Federal Agent Scully.
I'm Agent Mulder.
We're investigating a possible murder.
Well, there aren't many killings around here.
What can you tell me about the Kindred?
They keep pretty much
to themselves, huh?
Yeah, some folks say it's 'cause they're doing
ceremonies up there-- voodoo or something.
I've got nothing against them myself.
They bring in the tourists.
Did the Kindred let you take those pictures?
Oh, those-- those are from back in the '30s.
What about the missing ones?
I'm having them reframed.
They're right here under the counter.
Can I take a look at 'em?
Sure.
How would I get up to see them?
Well, they don't like strangers up there much.
The road's in pretty rough shape.
Steveston.
That's them now.
They usually shop at the feed store.
Whoa, boy.
Excuse me, ladies.
I think I'm going to go inside.
You need anything from the feed store?
Hi.
She must have problems on the asphalt.
Has she ever thrown a shoe?
What's her name?
Alice.
That's sweet.
Did you name her?
We named her all together.
I'm not allowed to talk outside.
That's all right.
I'm Dana Scully.
I don't mean you any harm.
Brother Andrew.
Scully, what are you doing?
I was just talking.
You all right?
Yeah. I think so.
You want to sit down?
Interesting way of life.
You get any sense about 'em?
There's something up there, Mulder.
Ooh, I've been saying that for years.
Oh, for a four-wheel drive.
Looks like about a mile walk.
After you.
Now...
this... that's west.
What does the map say?
That we should be there already.
Mulder, look.
Hmm?
We're FBI agents, federal police.
I'm Agent Mulder, this is Agent Scully.
We're here to investigate a murder.
I'm going to have to ask you
to remain at a distance.
Please, sir.
Your weapons
are forbidden here.
We can outlast you at this spot.
You're not leaving where we stand until your guns are handed
to our council.
You will have them again
as you leave.
We can't do that.
Please.
I'm Sister Abby.
This is Brother Oakley.
We are all saddened by what has happened in your world,
but it does not concern us.
Up here, no one kills another, ever.
We just want to have a few questions answered.
It is your weapons that are unwelcome here, not you.
Come and pray with us, be one of us,
and you'll see that we harm no one.
Please relinquish your weapons.
Please.
Now there is no reason to be afraid.
Come... sit.
Let us pray as one.
We who are separate give thanks
for our allotted time on this world.
We ask for strength
that we may bring forth the bounty that God
has provided.
Amen.
We pray for the day of the coming,
the moment of our release.
Amen.
Let us eat.
I was wondering if we might ask a few questions.
We're looking for someone
we believe may have come from here.
We have pictures.
We do not allow pictures.
A crime has been committed.
We have certain questions that we need answered
if you'll forgive us.
What are these pictures?
Hotel security videos of a man and a woman
who may have committed a murder.
Where was this crime committed?
In a hotel in Washington, D.C.
If we can arrange for you to look at the videotape,
maybe you can identify the individual.

That's all right.
We didn't take any offense.

Our brother must be admonished.
He can't breathe.
He does not need your help.
He's choking to death.
Remove Brother Aaron

We take care of our own.
Would you like to dance?
Not right now.
Look, I'm really not interested, okay?
Just one dance.
Yeah.

Thanks for your cooperation.
The Addams Family finds religion.
Take me back to the 20th century.
You believe all that back there, Scully?
Believe all what?
All that "we take care of our own" business?
Well, they'd better take care of their own,
or that man at the dinner table is a dead man.
I think it was all an elaborate act.
What, the choking?
No, all this simple life "living from abundance" crap.
These people know something, Scully.
You can see it in their eyes--
the way they look at one another.
Do you think they know who the murderer is?
Did you notice how they managed
not to answer a single question of ours?
And that outburst at the table was right on cue.
Somehow they got us to answer their questions.
Did you ask yourself why there weren't any children around?
I know, that was odd.
You want to know what's really odd?
You know those pictures we saw
down in the store in Steveston today,
the ones from the '30s?
I swear I saw some of those same faces
at the dinner table tonight.
These people have probably been intermarrying for years.
Maybe.
Maybe not everything
is as black and white as it appears to be.
What are you doing?
I'm gonna go back for a little look-see.
Maybe they went to the movies.
You hear that?
What do you think?
I think I want to see what's in that cellar.
Come with me.
I can give you information.
I know who did it.
The murders?
You've heard our prayers.

Does it have something to do
with the ceremony in the barn tonight?
What are you doing?
Scully.
Marty is different.
We're all different.
Oh.
No.
Scully.
Get off of her.
I asked you not to interfere.
What the hell were you doing back there?
I don't know.
You don't know? No.
Are you all right?
I wasn't ignoring you.
No. Of course I saw you.
I just...
I didn't recognize you.
That's all.
Excuse me.
I'm on a conversation.
Sorry. No.
Thanks.
How you feeling?
Better.
A little embarrassed, actually.
Why? You don't remember any of it.
It's like I don't remember...
Why didn't you get out of there before he...?
Because he told me he knew who the killer was.
How did you know he wasn't the killer?
I believed him.
So, what did you see down in the cellar?
Just Brother What's-His-Name
buried in some gopher hole in the wall--
buried alive.
How do you know he was alive?
Because I was in there with him, and his face was, was different.
Even his hair-- it was almost feminine.
It was like he was going through some kind of a transformation.
Changing sexes?
That would explain the hotel security video.
So you're saying these people...
I know what I saw, Scully, and I saw you
about to do the wild thing with some stranger.
Think he was trying to kill me?
Maybe it's the sex that kills.
Well, if he was trying to kill me, why did they let us go?
I don't know.
All right, let's break it up.
Out of the car.
Sorry, Officer.
You, too.
You a pro?

On a scale of one to ten, she was a kind three.
But there was something about her.
Did she touch you or make

I saw her in her clothes and she looked like a...
She looked like a man.
She was a man.
Hustling in the club scene used to be so simple.
It's off the record?
Scout's honor.
We can't rule out the possibility
that what we're looking for is a transvestite.
I think Don Juan in there knows the difference
between the male and the female of the species.
I just don't want us to ignore the obvious.
I mean, how else could you explain
a woman overpowering a 200-pound cop?
She was a he.
Agent Mulder, Agent Scully,
the credit card that was stolen
from the last victim in D.C.
was just used to order takeout in a hotel downtown,
about eight blocks from here.
It was always forbidden.
But after the first time, I couldn't help myself.
Touching a human man or a woman...
is as powerful for me as it was for you.
This is Agent Scully requesting police backup
and additional agents
at 771 Catherine Street-- it's the Hotel Catherine.
Your world offers pleasures...
pleasures we don't know because we're different.
But you know that now.
The others will punish me for what I've done.
They'll find me because the day is coming,
and they won't leave without me.
Mulder.
Delivery.
FBI!
FBI! Clear!
Stay down!
Got a body!
Scully?
I'm okay.
Scully, down the stairs.
Federal agent! I'm armed!
Back away!
Step away!
Step away.
Please...
don't hurt him.
No.
Step away.
I'm armed.
Scully!
The surrounding ten blocks
have been secured for the past hour.
We set up roadblocks
on all the routes out to Steveston.
So far nothing, no reports of them.
There's no way they could have gotten through.
What if they did get through?
There's only one place they'd hide.
They're gone.
We found something
in the hay field.
I don't understand.
How can they just disappear?
They have no means of transportation.
No earthly means of transportation.

ï»¿1 Hurry and get him out of there!
I need two men on the left side now!
Wait a second.
Where are you going with him?
He's dead.
Well, there's a woman over there who isn't
and she needs some oxygen.
Sir, stay back!
Get on the horn.
Let 'em know we can release the hook and ladder
in five minutes.
I want you to rise!
Rise up and heal!
What the hell are you doing?
Boy's laying on hands.
Rise up and accept the miracle
he's given you. Amen. Hallelujah.
You don't understand. The man's dead.
Then the boy can't possibly do any harm, now, can he?
For this
is the power of belief--
the power to separate the light from the darkness
to create life from death.
Amen.
All right, everyone! Show's over!
Let's clear the area!
Start getting that one
into the back of the truck!
Hallelujah, son.
Hallelujah.
Oh, hallelujah!
Oh, yes!
Hallelujah.
Yes, indeed, and praise God!
Yes!
Yes! Yes!
I want everybody to say hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
Praise the Lord!
The woman on the table
has a malignant tumor on her spine.
This boy here is going to attempt
to heal her by simply laying his hands on her.
Where did you get this? It came in
from the regional office in Tennessee.
The preacher's name is...
Reverend Calvin Hartley.
You've heard of him.
The boy is his adopted son, Samuel.
He claims to have found him as an infant
lying in the tall weeds
on the banks of the muddy Mississippi.
Did you know that he also claims
the boy brought a man back from the dead?
It's more than a claim.
The man he saved appears as a regular attraction
in the reverend's tent ministry.
The boy's been performing miracles
every week for the past ten years.
Twice on Sunday.
Well, not according to the Kenwood County Sheriff.
Local authorities think
that Reverend Hartley and his son are a scam.
They've been trying to shut them down
for some time now, but without any luck,
so they've turned to the FBI to try and get a prosecution.
For what? Fraud? No.
Murder.
Watch the tape.
Lucy Kelly has the cancer.
Her doctors say it is inoperable.
They say it is incurable.
But I say to you
that what the doctors cannot cure,
the Lord can.
Amen!
Yes, indeed. Praise God.
Because God...
can work... miracles.
The clear light of God's healing love...
is flowing...
through Samuel's healing hands.
20 minutes later, Lucy Kelly was rushed to the hospital.
She was pronounced dead on arrival.
What was the cause death?
I don't know, but it wasn't cancer.
They've requested someone with a medical background
to assist local police in the investigation.
I know this isn't an X file...
When do we leave for Tennessee?
I think I saw some of these same people at Woodstock.
Mulder, you weren't at Woodstock.
I saw the movie.
You all right by yourself?
I'll be fine.
I won't be long.
Most of you here today, I know as neighbors
and as cherished members of our Miracle Ministry.
But, uh, some of you have come from far away...
as far away
as Pensacola, Florida...
And Uniondale, Long Island!
Wayne Ashtown and his family.
And it is especially to those of you
who come from so far
that I must apologize from the bottom of my heart...
because, unfortunately,
Samuel cannot be here this afternoon.
I know... I know how very deeply disappointed
each and every one of you must be feeling right now,
but I say unto you, do not be dismayed.
Do not despair!
Do not lose your hope...
because in two short days, Samuel will be back here
at our very special Miracle Mission!
Yes, indeed, praise God. He will be back here...
Maybe we should head backstage
and see what the reverend has to say.
No, wait, wait. This is the part where they bring out Elvis.
...on the faithful, because as these
blessed people up here are about to testify,
Samuel can heal you.
Yes, Samuel will heal you.
But...
only if you believe.
God bless you!
Reverend Hartley, we're with the FBI.
I see Sheriff Daniels has sent in the cavalry.
We just want to talk to Samuel
for a couple of minutes.
That's all. He's not here.
Well, where is he?
I don't know.
I haven't seen him.
The boy's been a bit troubled lately.
We're running late, Reverend.
If you'll excuse me.
Agent Mulder?
Yeah.
Sheriff Daniels.
We spoke on the phone. Oh, yeah.
This is Special Agent Dana Scully.
Right.
You requested a copy of the coroner's report.
Right. Thank you.
I see you folks got a chance
to take in the holy roller sideshow.
Something tells me you're not a member
of the Reverend Hartley's flock.
Well, I remember Hartley
when he was a soapbox preacher
collecting dollar bills in coffee cans.
Since the boy joined the act,
he's got himself a Cadillac for every day of the week,
bought for with money that should be used
to improve our roads and schools.
People want to believe, you know.
99% of the people in this world are fools,
and the rest of us are in great danger of contagion.
Even if Hartley and Samuel are fakes,
it's still a long way
from accusing the boy of murder.
I got witnesses that say the boy was there
laying hands on those people when they died.
You think that's how he killed them, with a touch?
I don't claim to know
how or why he did it,
but we've been looking for the boy since Tuesday
and he does not want to be found.
There's nothing out of the ordinary about these reports
except that there were no autopsies performed.
Hartley managed to block my autopsy request
on religious grounds.
Also doesn't help that the county coroner
is a dues-paying member of the Miracle Ministry.
Well, maybe we can arrange
to have the bodies exhumed.
Sheriff...
It's Reverend Hartley's group.
Damn.
I told my people to keep quiet so this wouldn't happen.
Looks like you might have a few believers
on the payroll.
On behalf of the Miracle Ministry,
we demand that you stop this sacrilege.
You're not just dealing with me anymore, Vance.
You're dealing with the FBI.
We don't mean you any disrespect.
We're investigating a possible homicide.
And federal law requires that we do
a postmortem examination on these bodies.
Well, I'm afraid we answer to an even higher authority
than the U.S. government-- one that considers grave digging
and defiling corpses mortal sins.
We'll get that autopsy, Vance.
Sooner or later, you know we will.
The deceased's family
does not want her grave disturbed.
Carol Wallace had no family.
We were her family.
We were her family
and it was hard enough to bury her once.
So if you insist on going through with this,
we're prepared to maintain a vigil
and do whatever it takes to stop you.
Mulder,
Scully...
What?
One of my men just spotted the boy car's downtown.
Can't do much here anyway.
Let's go.
Check the side door, okay?
Not a very likely place to be saving souls.
Where's the boy, Zook?
He's in the can.
What happened here?
Damn fool started a fight.
Figures them Bible thumpers
wouldn't know how to hold their liquor.
Where you been, Samuel?
We've been looking for you.
Yeah?
I've been thinking.
Well, you're going to have plenty of time
for that now, son.
I'm putting you under arrest.
For murder?
For suspicion of murder.
Mind if I finish my beer first?
Well, you go right on ahead.
I'm going to have somebody take a statement from you.
I'll see what I can do about getting your Caddy towed.
Hey, Sheriff.
What evidence do you have
to charge the boy with murder?
Well, what more do you want?
The boy's practically giving himself up.
Look at him, though. He's drunk.
Well, then I'll add drunk and disorderly.
Let's get this straight.
It's not a question about the boy's guilt,
just how he did it.
Let me have a minute with him.
Suit yourself.
Samuel, I'm Agent Mulder.
This is Agent Scully.
We're from the FBI.
Looks like you took quite a beating there.
Penance, Mr. Mulder.
Some might call it a plain old bar brawl.
You know what they say--
"he giveth and he taketh away."
Man gets too proud,
sometimes it does him good
to get the crap kicked out of him.
Saves God the trouble.
The trouble of what?
Humbling the guilty sinner.
Guilty of murder?
Yes, sir.
How did you do it, Samuel?
Apparently, my pride and my weakness
were an invitation to the devil.
I muddied the river of my own faith.
Now my gift has been corrupted.
So you're saying that you killed those people with a touch?
I've laid my hands on the ill, given them health.
I've healed the sick.
I've even touched the dying and given them life.
God has given me a special gift.
Did he buy you all that jewelry, too?
I think there's something missing in your story, Samuel.
You doubt the power of God, ma'am?
No, but I doubt the veracity of your claims.
I have looked on the infirm and seen their sickness--
their cancer.
Just as I can see the pain
on this man right here.
Really?
What pain is that?
The pain you have...
regarding a brother
or a sister.
It's an old pain.
It's never been healed.
Is this some kind of a trick?
No trick, ma'am.
I think we should get the sheriff.
I want to hear more about this pain.
Tell me.
I could see it, plain as day.
It was a sister.
You lost a sister quite young.
Someone took her away.
What else do you see?
Strangers...
a bright light.
Sheriff...
You should have come here earlier.
Chance I could have healed your pain.
All right, let's get this over with.
Hey, I need another minute with him.
I can't help you, not anymore.
My gift is gone.
Cuff him.
All right, let's go.
You have the right to remain silent.
I'll tell you, Mr. Mulder--
God watches over his flock.
He gives us signs every day.
Open your heart.
He might just open your eyes.
How do you think he does it?
I don't know.
Given his exemplary record
and the highly circumstantial nature
of this case,
I ask that my client be released
on his own recognizance
without bail...
Judge, that is not a good idea.
Samuel!
Let me go, and it will be
on your head. Enough.
This is not a pulpit.
This is a court of law.
Is that understood?
Yes, sir.
Sorry.
Your Honor, despite the defendant's
avowed guilt,
we see no reason to burden the county
with his maintenance until trial.
But we do request a minimum bail of $100,000.
All right, if there are no objections,
bail is set at $100,000
to be deposited directly into the clerk's
probation account.
My God!
What is...
Good God!
By God!
God, what is it?!
What is this?
What...
Oh, God!
How much more
will it take for you to believe?
The Lord has testified against me.
Does the serpent have to bite y'all
on the ass till you understand?
Everybody, clear this courtroom!
"And when it was morning,
"the east wind brought the locusts
"and the locusts covered the face of the whole earth
"so that the land was darkened.
And they did eat every herb of the land..."
Come on, Mulder.
and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left..."
A few thousand grasshoppers does not constitute a plague.
Besides which, we're in farm country.
And this area is an agricultural smorgasbord
for this type of infestation.
Yeah, maybe in a cornfield.
But this happened in a courtroom.
So what's next?
The slaying of the firstborn?
Mulder, does this have something to do
with what Samuel said in the bar last night
about your sister?
I had these patient cases sent over
from Kenwood County Hospital.
These are physician- documented cases
of patients who went to Samuel
after conventional treatments failed.
"Spontaneous remission of metastatic cancer...
regenerated nerve growth after post-trauma paraplegia..."
I have encountered dozens
of psychic healers in the X files, but none like this.
I think the kid's for real.
Mulder, I admit this is intriguing,
but there's a whole library of medical literature
dealing with unexplained spontaneous cures.
Now, Western medicine treats the human body
in biochemical terms, right?
be treated as an electromagnetic system.
So your theory is that if Samuel
can repair this energy field in order to heal,
he can also destroy it in order to kill.
Why not? Okay.
Say that Samuel's touch can kill.
Why would he want to?
Well, you heard him, Scully.
He muddied the river of his own faith.
That means he's...
If you're available,
Reverend would like to see you.
I've been under a great deal of stress lately,
which I know doesn't excuse my rude behavior yesterday,
but I hope somehow you found it in your hearts to forgive me.
Why did you want to speak with us?
I need your help.
Samuel is being tried for murder.
I think what you need is a good lawyer.
Samuel is innocent.
How can you be sure of that?
Because he's my son.
Somehow I don't think
that argument will work on a jury.
And Samuel's confession won't help much, either.
You have to understand--
Samuel is a very complicated young man.
He feels things like no one else.
To him, a pinprick becomes a gaping wound.
His power comes
from this ability to feel.
But, you see, some people fear that power.
And out of their weakness and their fear,
they seek to destroy it.
You mean Sheriff Daniels.
I mean, it's no secret
Sheriff Daniels has been trying to shut me down
since I first opened my tent ten years ago.
Well, he seems to think that your ministry is a fraud.
He's a faithless man, Agent Scully.
His wife, she suffers from a most painful arthritis.
Her fingers twisted like bitter roots.
Yet he keeps Samuel from ministering to her.
In light of recent events, you can't blame him.
I don't know how those poor people died.
I can't explain that.
Which is why I'm asking you to be there tonight
so you could see for yourselves
Samuel doing God's work.
Can I count on you both to be there?
I think so.
Mulder, what do you think?
Excuse me.
Hey, where'd she go?
Who?
The little girl.
There's no little girl around here.
Mulder...
What is it?
It's a girl.
Who, Jessica Hahn?
A little girl.
Well, brothers and sisters, help yourselves.
Let the folks with the wheelchairs through now.
That's right. Don't be shy.
Hello there.
Welcome to the Miracle Ministry.
Y'all come to see Samuel tonight?
Yes.
Is he going to be here? The papers said...
Oh, well, now, don't mind what you read in the papers.
God's work will be done.
Young Samuel is here to cast out the devil
and heal the sick.
Did you hear that, honey?
Will he be able to see me?
Well, I'll tell you what--
I'm going to put in a special word, hmm?
What's your name, darling?
Margaret Hohman. Margaret?
Well, Margaret, you wait right here.
I'm going to see if I can't get somebody
to put you in the front row. How'd that be?
Huh?
I can't go out there.
Not after what's happened.
God tests the faith in us all, son.
And because he's chosen you to act in his likeness,
he's given you the toughest test of all.
Do not forsake your gift, Samuel.
Aw, man.
I'm a preacher, son.
That's my gift.
But all the preaching in the world
could never equal even a small miracle
in consolidating the faith and hope
of these people.
Let this man-- whose life you saved--
give witness tonight to the grace and goodness
of your healing power.
They're all waiting on you, Samuel.
Ready, you got to be ready
Get ready for the Reverend Calvin Hartley!
Ready when Jesus comes.
Yes, indeedy!
Praise God!
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
Praise the Lord!
Praise the Lord!
God is here tonight.
Oh, yes.
Pass it down, please.
I feel his presence. Oh, amen!
Apparently miracles don't come cheap.
God is here,
and he...
is here...
to heal!
Yes, heal!
Hallelujah.
There's a man
I'd like to introduce to you--
a man who has seen the face of God
but who was not satisfied to go to that great place. Oh, no.
No, God had work for him to do right here on earth.
As it is in Heaven, mm-hmm.
I saw this man come back
from beyond death's door.
He stands here today as a living testament
to the ability of God
to work miracles.
Ladies and gentlemen,
brothers and sisters...
our beloved friend, Leonard Vance.
As it says in John,
chapter three--
"No man can do these miracles unless God be with him."
That man to whom I owe my life
is Samuel Hartley.
And he is here tonight to heal you.
Thank you, Leonard.
Ladies and gentlemen--
God's solider, Samuel Hartley.
Mulder!
Receive God's love.
Feel the power of God.
Pray with me.
Close your eyes.
What have you done, boy?
All right, everyone, remain calm.
Give the young woman some room here.
Everybody, praise God.
Say hallelujah, now!
Somebody, get an ambulance!
It's all right!
Don't panic, now. Just praise the Lord!
She's dead.
Loving friends,
children of God,
brothers and sisters,
if you desecrate the body,
then you slay the soul.
Let's keep this poor woman's body intact.
We know that Reverend Hartley's
been pressuring you,
but this is the third death linked
with the Miracle Ministry.
Reverend Hartley says
an autopsy is against Scripture.
What illness did your daughter suffer from, Mr. Hohman?
She had M.S.
And has she ever had a seizure before this?
Not to my knowledge.
You see, I think that the seizure she had
is indicative of some kind of embolism or aneurysm.
But the boy only touched her forehead.
And are you going to be content
to bury her without knowing the true cause of death?
Without knowing if there was foul play involved?
Give me a moment.
You think the boy really did it?
No.
Why not?
I was raised a Catholic
and I have a certain familiarity with the Scripture
and God never lets the devil steal the show.
You must have really liked The Exorcist.
One of my favorite movies.
Well...
So who were you pursuing in the crowd tonight?
I thought I saw someone I knew.
That boy really has you going, doesn't he?
Why do you say that?
In the bar, Samuel mentioned your sister.
Is it your sister you keep thinking you're seeing?
I've seen her twice now.
Maybe you just want to see her.
I'm not delusional, Scully.
Mulder, don't discount the power of suggestion.
A healer's greatest magic
lies in the patient's willingness to believe.
Imagine a miracle and you're halfway there.
We learned that in med school.
You think this is what Margaret Hohman
or her parents were imagining?
We're going to go along with your investigation.
It's 11:21 p.m., March 7.
Subject's name is Margaret Hohman.
Female, Caucasian,
107 pounds.
Mulder, take a look at this.
Do I have to?
Lesions on the lungs here.
I'm finding them
throughout the cardiovascular
and pulmonary systems.
There's also a lot of damage to the mucous membranes.
I think that she must have died from cellular hypoxia--
a lack of oxygen to the cells.
What would cause that?
My guess? Ingestion or injection
of sodium or potassium cyanide, maybe arsenic.
I won't know exactly
until I run a toxicology screen on her.
How soon?
Labs won't be open till morning.
See who you can push to get it done--
as soon as possible.
Samuel, it's Agent Mulder.
Yeah? What do you want?
I want to talk with you.
If you'd prefer your attorney were present...
Whatever. No.
I put a call in to Sheriff Daniels.
He's on his way down here.
I'm going to ask him to release you.
Why are you doing this?
You were there, man.
You saw for yourself.
Did you poison Margaret Hohman?
Did I poison her?
Did you poison her
using potassium or sodium cyanide?
Because that's what killed her.
What are you talking about?
You're innocent, Samuel.
Unless you had a hand in administering it,
and I don't think you did.
Whatever the cause, Mr. Mulder, I am responsible.
Well, the evidence
will be presented at your arraignment tomorrow.
Habeas corpus law will force them to release you,
so you might as well go home and get some rest anyway.
Just leave me alone, okay?
Look, Samuel, if you think that the punishment for your sins
is the deaths of those people...
The Lord has testified against me, Mr. Mulder.
I can't stand here and argue with your Biblical rhetoric,
but I do know that the law will find you innocent.
You said you could see my pain.
Look at me.
What do you see now?
I see nothing.
I am blind.
I don't believe you.
I've seen her.
It was her, wasn't it?
Your sister?
You made her appear to me, didn't you?
Look at me.
I am very tired, Mr. Mulder.
Is she alive?!
Is that what I'm supposed to believe
or is this a trick?
You mean...
a trick of the devil?
Jailer!
I see I'm a little late for this ball.
Called you down here to ask you to release the boy.
On what pretense? His innocence.
Aren't you a little out of your depth here, Agent Mulder?
This may be Hicksville to you,
but we do try and hew to the legal system.
I don't want to pick a fight.
He seems determined to stay here anyway.
What does that tell you?
It tells me you're determined to have him charged
while your real homicide suspect is still at large.
I got some company for you, Sam.
What are you looking at?
I'll get it.
I'll get it.
Ma'am.
Sheriff.
Hey, Dennis.
How are you?
Just fine, ma'am, just fine.
Except we had an incident down at the jail.
What incident would that be, Tyson?
The preacher boy.
He's dead.
He was alone in his cell
when Mulder left him this morning.
How could this have happened?
The boy started a fight
with a couple of rowdies we picked up on a DUI.
Took some pretty mean blows to the head.
Died before the ambulance got here.
His blood is spilled
and it's all over you!
Reverend...
How much longer
are you going to hide behind that badge
before the truth is revealed?
I have work to do.
Reverend Hartley...
We're sorry for your loss.
That boy... he was blessed.
He never hurt a soul.
Come on there, Reverend.
Our friends will be finding out about Samuel
sooner than later, and, well...
it's probably best if they hear from you.
Come on.
Ma'am.
You got that look on your face, Mulder.
What look is that?
The kind when you've forgotten your keys
and you're trying to figure out
how to get back in the house.
What exactly are we trying to find?
Clues.
Oh.
What does it mean?
Let's find out.
Scully.
It's potato.
Someone left a trail of food
in the ventilation system leading to the courtroom.
You dump your locusts in here...
instant plague.
Well, where did they all come from?
Biological supply houses usually hatch them
on order to farms and universities.
Shouldn't be too hard to find out who set this up.
And you think whoever did this
is responsible for the murders.
You're dead.
They killed you.
I was dead...
but here I am.
No!
Why did you betray me?
You murdered those people.
They came to me to be healed
and you murdered them.
Why?
After I gave you back your life.
You call this life?!
What in tarnation do you want?
We have a warrant for the arrest of Leonard Vance.
Where is he?
You must be mistaken.
I'm afraid not, Reverend.
We traced a pesticide order to him
from a chemical company in Knoxville.
Cyanogen bromide-- it's a cyanide derivative.
Leonard poisoned those people?
Get your clothes on, Vance.
You're under arrest.
I betrayed him.
Cyanide.
There's no way to tell how much he's ingested.
I'll call an ambulance.
It's too late. We have to
get him to the hospital ourselves.
I thought, "Why didn't he let me die?"
Beware of false prophets
who come to you in sheep's clothing
but inwardly are... are ravening wolves.
That's what I thought he was
because who else would bring me back
looking like this?
He was here.
Who?
Samuel.
The man's delirious.
He was here, Reverend.
Right in this room...
and he forgave me.
Rather than simply killing Samuel,
Vance contrived to kill the ministry's faith in him.
We have conclusive evidence
connecting him both to the courtroom infestation
and to the poisoning deaths
of three members of the ministry.
Vance's obsession outlived Samuel, however.
His conscience haunted him until he became delusory
and finally took his own life,
effectively ending our investigation.
In light of this information, it is highly doubtful
that there have ever been any miracles
in Kenwood, Tennessee.
Mulder.
Scully.
Sheriff Daniels just called.
Samuel's body is missing from the morgue.
Any witnesses?
One, so far.
The night nurse who made the report--
Beatrice Salinger.
She saw somebody take the body?
Not actually.
What do you mean, "not actually"?
Talk sense, Deputy.
She didn't exactly see anyone taking the body.
Well, what, then?
She, uh...
she claims she saw Samuel walking out by himself.
Sounds crazy, I know, but that's what she told me.
You coming, Sheriff?
I was drinking my coffee
and going over the night orders
for my ward, seven south,
when he walked right by me.
His face was all black and blue.
And you're sure it was him?
Well, at first I thought my eyes were playing tricks,
which happens a lot on graveyard,
so I got up to look again,
but I lost him around a corner.
He just vanished.
Then I went to check the morgue,
and his body was gone.
I don't believe this. This is insane.
I'm not going to listen to any more
of this woman's crazy talk.
I'm not the only one who saw him, Sheriff,
so I know I'm not crazy.
Other people saw him, too.
I'm not crazy.
It was Samuel.
This isn't true, Maurice.
Is it?
The boy was an awful fake
just like you said, wasn't he, Maurice?
Wasn't he, Maurice?
Sir...
going to have to ask you
to come with me.
District attorney
wants to ask you some questions
concerning the boy's death.
Sundays will probably never be the same again
in these parts.
I have a strong sense the Reverend Hartley
is not going to be able to give up the pulpit.
Even without his son?
Might even strengthen his faith.
Remember, the boy did rise from the dead.
That kind of thing happens only once or twice
every 2,000 years or so.
Yeah, and I have a story about a plague of locusts.
I just hope Reverend Hartley
didn't arrange his body snatching
as his miracle of miracles.
Somehow, I don't think so.
What exactly do you think?
I think people are looking hard for miracles.
So hard that maybe they make themselves see
what they want to see.
You coming, Mulder?

What is your present location?
Unit 50, go ahead.
Suspect now westbound.
Has entered the gate of the shipworks
off April Street.
Unit 50 still in pursuit. Over.
All right, Unit 50, I copy.
Keep me advised...
This is the police!
Pull your vehicle over and stop!
Stop your vehicle!
Put your hands on the roof and freeze!
Hold it!
Get on the ground!
Do it!
You hear me?!
Face down! Do it!
Stay down!
Unit 106, go ahead.
Stop!
Armed officer!
I hit him.
I know I hit him.
Where the hell did he go?
He'd be bleeding bad.
The Lipari Island group off the coast of Italy.
But-but theirs is a very light lava, sir.
That's exactly what stumped me.
Because inside, there must be something
the weight of the heaviest rock in existence.
But, Professor, that-that would be Icelandic peridotite.
Precisely.
There's a piece chipped off.
By me.
Well, what's the rock inside?
Icelandic peridotite, naturally.
When I saw this, I stopped chipping.
But how could a rock from Iceland...
Mulder.
Are you watching channel eight?
...across the world?
What's your conclusion?
Science does not jump to conclusions.
Science is not a guessing game.
...where a 60-mile high-speed car chase
ended early this evening--
the suspect alluding capture by leaping into the harbor,
but not before reportedly
injuring several Ardis police officers.
We have Captain Roy Lacerio standing by.
Captain, how was the man able to escape
and how seriously injured were the officers involved?
Those details are still unclear.
I'll be talking with several of the...
We need you, Captain.
I'm sorry, you'll have to excuse me.
Captain Roy Lacerio being pulled away here
during an intense manhunt.
No additional information has been released.
...Lacerio being pulled away here
during an intense...
Mulder, you've been through this tape 100 times.
What exactly are you hoping to find?
I don't know.
And all he told you
was to watch channel eight?
Yeah, that's all he said.
Do we even know why the suspect was being chased?
As far as I can tell,
he wouldn't pull over for a moving violation.
Well, that ought to put him
on the ten most wanted list.
There's got to be something here.
Some detail-- something we're not seeing.
How do you know he's not just yanking your chain,
this Deep Throat character?
Why would he do that?
Well, he has lied to you, by his own admission.
I don't think he'd call if there wasn't something here--
something I'm supposed to see,
something he wants me to see.
Then what are you missing?
I don't know if you're aware, but there were
three different law enforcement agencies out here last night.
Hunting a man on a moving violation?
I know it's not Silence of the Lambs,
but it's what we do.
This man in the photograph doesn't appear to be
wearing a badge or a uniform.
He's not one of yours? No, sir.
But, like I said, it was a zoo out here.
You say the suspect was shot.
Any explanation why the body hasn't been recovered?
As you can see, we got our search ongoing.
Divers down there in shifts.
We're quite certain he will be found.
It's been almost 18 hours, Captain.
Where could the body be?
There are cables and debris all over the bottom.
It's a painstaking business.
Can I ask what the FBI's interest in this case would be?
The suspect matches
the description of a federal fugitive.
Really? How's that?
No description of the suspect has been released.
If you don't mind, can we take a look
at the car, please?
It's been taken to impound.
The report says that the car was registered
to a rental agency in Gaithersburg.
They had no idea the car was even missing.
You know, Mulder, I think that we're wasting our time here.
I don't know what the hell I'm supposed to find.
You can't make out the license plate in this photo.
Hey, Scully, look at this.
What?
Look at the car in the photo.
Look at the windshield.
It's not the same car.
It's called a caduceus.
It's sort of the adopted symbol
of the medical profession.
So probably only a doctor would have that on his car.
Mm-hmm.
I had the picture enhanced, and the plate is different.
"3 A-Y-F."
Fast-forward.
That's all you can make out; the rest is obscured.
Hey, Danny, it's Mulder.
I need you to run a Maryland plate for me.
All I got is a partial.
Registered to a doctor-- or used to be.
Yeah, I'll hold.
They switched cars on us, Scully, and they lied about it.
Why would they do that?
Maybe the real owner of the car has got something to hide.
Dr. Berube?
Yes?
We're with the FBI.
Can we have a minute of your time?
I'm actually very busy. I'm sorry.
Are you aware that a car registered to you
was involved in a high-speed chase
in Ardis yesterday?
Excuse me?
A silver Ciera, Doctor.
Do you own a silver Ciera?
Yes.
It was used for what?
A crime. Were you aware it was even missing?
Not until you mentioned it.
I have a housekeeper, and she often uses the car.
It's a second car...
Please!
They should not be excited.
Nothing should be touched.
I'm sorry, I thought they were friendly.
They're part of an experiment.
What kind of experiment?
Am I under some kind of suspicion?
No.
Then I think I've answered
all your questions.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have more work than time.
Thank you.
Did he bite you?
No, but he tried to.
Well, it's almost 5:00.
We should check with the doctor's housekeeper
about the car while we're out here.
No.
No? What do you mean, no?
I mean, this has reached the point of absurdity, Mulder.
We're out here on half a hunch, off of a cryptic phone call,
chasing down a clue that's based on nothing but speculation.
Well, that's all we've got.
That's all he's given us.
Who is this Deep Throat character?
I mean, we don't know anything about him--
what his name is, what he does.
He's in a delicate position.
He has access to information,
and indiscretion could expose him.
You don't know that this isn't just a game with him.
He's toying with you.
Rationing out the facts.
You think he does it because he gets off on it?
No. I think he does it because you do.
Calling it a night,
Mr. Mulder?
My mother usually likes me home
before the street lights come on.
I'm surprised at you.
Why?
Your level of commitment seems to have diminished.
My level of commitment?
I should've expected that you'd be working through the night
trying to put the pieces together.
Well, maybe if you'd given me something more to work with.
Under the circumstances, I've given you all I can.
A news report?
And where has it led you?
Not very far.
It may be further than you realize.
You know, from day one, this has always been on your terms.
I've gone along, been the dutiful son.
But maybe this time we can just cut out the Obi-Wan Kenobi crap
and you can save me the trouble.
I fear you've become too dependant on me.
Let me tell you something.
I've got plenty to do without chasing down your vague leads
or trying to decode your circular logic.
Maybe it's you who's become too dependant on me--
on my willingness to play your games.
Mr. Mulder?
What?
Don't give up on this one.
Trust me.
You've never been closer.
Closer to what?
Hello?
Who's there?
Working late tonight, Doctor?
What do you want here?
He's alive, isn't he?
Has he contacted you?
Please.
You're going to have to leave.
If you're from the FBI,
I've already answered all your questions!
What questions?
I had nothing to say to them.
I have nothing to say to you.
Where's Dr. Secare?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Please.
My work is very important.
I must get on with my work.
I'm afraid...
your work is done.
Anybody see anything?
No.
Nothing.
That's it, I'm calling it off.
Shore to RC-1,
bring it in.
Visibility...
There's nothing down there-- three days.
Forget it.
The county sheriff's office
is conducting the investigation.
On the preliminary reports,
it's being listed as a suicide.
Suicide?
Yeah, they think that, for whatever reason,
he trashed his lab and then killed himself.
How?
Well, it says he tied one end of a roll of medical gauze
around his neck
and the other end to this gas outlet.
Then he jumped.
I don't suppose there were any witnesses.
Nope.
The man we met yesterday
kept this place like he was
waiting for the people from Good Housekeeping to show up.
I would never have pegged him as someone to do this.
Or a Greg Louganis out the window.
I know. That gauze is troubling.
It's a bit too calculated, huh?
Almost as if someone wanted to make doubly sure
he'd break his neck before he hit the ground.
What else do we know about Dr. Berube?
Um...
"Terrence Allen Berube.
Harvard Med, 1974."
He was working on the Human Genome Project.
Are you familiar with that?
Yeah. The mapping of all human genes.
Maybe the most ambitious scientific endeavor
in the history of mankind.
Right, but there's nothing extraordinary about that.
I mean, there were thousands of scientists
working on that project.
Yeah, but only one who owned a silver Ciera and went
bungee jumping with medical gauze wrapped around his neck.
I'm sorry, Mulder, I'm seeing the pieces,
but I'm not seeing the connection.
Well, maybe that's just it.
Maybe we're not seeing it because...
it can't be seen, not in any obvious way.
What do you think this is?
I don't know.
Can you find out for me?
What are you gonna do?
I'll see what else I can find out
about Dr. Terrence Allen Berube.
Okay, Mulder, but I'm warning you.
If this is monkey pee, you're on your own.
Yeah.
My first impression is it's some kind of bacteria specimen.
Can I ask you where you got it?
It was recovered at a crime scene.
We've come a long way
from Colonel Mustard in the den with a rope, haven't we?
I'm expecting it'll turn out to be nothing.
No.
No, you've definitely got something here.
Wow. Look at this.
What are they?
Well, they're the size of bacteria,
but no bacteria I've ever seen.
How do you mean?
Well, most bacteria are symmetrical and smooth.
These are... I don't know...
strange.
You have no way of identifying them?
Well, we could do a freeze fracture.
Take a thin slice off
and see what's going on inside these babies.
If you don't mind waiting.
No. No, I'll wait.
Hi, Danny. Yeah, it's Mulder again.
Look, I got a number this time.
555-2804, area code 301.
I need an address, a name if you can get it for me.
All right. I'm at, uh...
same prefix, 1517.
All right. Thanks, Danny.
That was fast.
Terry, is that you?
Yeah.
Who's this?
They shot me, Terry.
Oh, God.
I've been in the water for three days.
I'm hurt.
Where are you now?
I'm at a pay phone.
I'm gonna pick you up. Where are you?
Terry...
Hello? Hello?
You okay?
Are you there?
Hello?
Hello. This man's been hurt here.
I think he needs medical attention.
What's the street? What's the street?
I'm going to call an ambulance.
Sir?
Don't hang up.
I got it.
Hi, Danny.
Let me get the address.
All right, you ready? Let me just...
Mulder?
I'm just writing it down now. Go ahead.
All right, the number belongs to a company called Zeus Storage.
1616 Pandora Street.
Yeah. 1616 Pandora Street.
That's it.
All right, thanks.
Okay, we've got a white male, 40, weak vitals,
with signs of severe dyspnea and hypotension.
He also what appears to be a green fluid
coming from a wound in his right upper quadrant.
I don't know what the hell that is.
Is he responding to ventilation?
No, and we're noticing those rope veins at the neck
and a hypersonant sounding chest.
He's going real blue on us now.
Okay, you've got a tension pneumothorax.
I want you to perform a thoracotomy
and release the pressure in his chest.
Okay, I'm gonna need a cannula.
We're gonna do a needle decompression.
Mobile van, what's going on?
Mobile men, can you hear me?
Mobile men, answer me!
Mobile men, what is the problem?!
Mobile men, come in please!
Mulder.
It's me.
He's alive, Scully.
Who?
The fugitive, the driver of the silver Ciera.
He called the doctor's house while I was there.
Where is he now?
I don't know. Where are you?
I'm at the Georgetown Microbiology Department.
I've got something for you.
Is it smaller than a silver Ciera?
Much.
And it's not silver. It's green.
What is it?
Some kind of bacteria, each containing virus.
And it looks as if Berube may have been cloning them.
They also contain something that looks like chloroplasts--
plant cells.
But they've never seen anything like it here.
Any idea what he could've been doing with them?
Well, the only reason why you'd clone a virus inside a bacteria
is in order to inject it into something living.
It's called gene therapy,
and it's still highly experimental.
Well, maybe that's what he was doing with those monkeys.
Can they tell you anything else there?
Yeah, they're just about to run some primary cell cultures
and a DNA sequence.
Now, I may be understating the strangeness of this, Mulder.
Bacteria like this--
it may have existed, but not for millions of years.
Not since before our ancestors first crawled out of the sea.
Are you there, Mulder?
Mulder?
Yeah.
Scully, keep up the good work.
Agent Scully.
Oh, Dr. Carpenter, I fell asleep.
I've done some work.
These are the DNA sequences
from the bacteria sample you brought in.
You seem to know something about molecular biology.
You know what you're looking at?
Yeah, I think those are genes.
Right. They're called base pairs.
Each pair is made up of something called a nucleotide.
Only four nucleotides exist in DNA-- four.
And through some miracle of design
that we have yet to fathom,
every living thing is created
out of these four basic building blocks.
What you're looking at is a sequence of genes
from the bacteria sample.
Normally, we'd find no gaps in the sequence.
But with these bacteria, we do.
Why is that?
I don't know why.
But I tell you, under any other circumstances,
my first call would have been to the government.
What exactly did you find?
A fifth and sixth DNA nucleotide--
a new base pair.
Agent Scully, what you are looking at--
it exists nowhere in nature.
It would have to be by definition...
extraterrestrial.
Hello.
Mulder? Where on God's earth have you been?
I've been trying to call you all night.
I had a situation.
I left my phone in the car.
Mulder...
that bacteria I had analyzed--
they're saying that it doesn't exist in nature.
They're saying that it could be extraterrestrial.
Scully...
What?
How soon can you be here?
There's something I got to show you.
Wait a second.
Mulder...
I just want to say that I was wrong.
That's all right. Don't worry about it.
No, um...
if you'd have listened to me, we wouldn't be here right now.
I should know by now to trust your instincts.
Why? Nobody else does.
You know, I've always
held science as sacred.
I've always put my trust in the accepted facts.
And what I saw last night...
for the first time in my life, I don't know what to believe.
Whatever it is you do believe, Scully,
when you walk into that room...
nothing sacred will hold.
There were tanks here...
and five bodies suspended in solution.
There were computers monitoring them.
They were alive, Scully, underwater.
What happened to them?
God only knows.
Most likely they've been destroyed.
Miss Scully.
I believe we met ever so briefly.
Destroyed by whom?
I don't know.
I don't believe you.
There are limits to my knowledge,
Mr. Mulder.
Inside the intelligence community,
there are so-called black organizations--
groups within groups conducting covert activities
unknown at the highest levels of power.
There were three men last night; I was chased.
If you were chased, you would have been killed.
Those men are trained for that sort of business,
and they are trained well.
Were those the same men who killed Dr. Berube?
Presumably.
Why?
Why?
Good Lord.
You've worked so hard
and you still don't see it.
Dr. Berube was conducting human experiments
with extraterrestrial viruses.
Yes, but that's been going on for years.
We've had the tissue since 1947,
but not the technology.
Roswell?
Roswell was a smoke screen.
We've had a half a dozen better salvage operations.
Dr. Berube was killed
because his work was too successful.
You're standing in the room
where the first DNA transplant took,
the first human-alien hybrid was created.
Six volunteer patients, all terminally ill.
One, Dr. William Secare,
an old friend of Dr. Berube's was dying of melanoma cancer.
And as a result of the E.T. gene therapy,
all six patients treated in this room
began to recover from their illnesses.
Dr. Secare was able to live
a more or less normal life--
as normal as possible
for a man who has developed inhuman strength
and the ability to breathe underwater.
That's how he was able to elude capture.
What was he running from?
Dr. Secare was never supposed to have survived.
Dr. Berube's research was
part of a top secret government project
being run out of Los Alamos.
All they were interested in was the technology, the science.
To have a hybrid
living out in the real world-- too great a liability.
What if he should need
emergency medical procedure?
The man has a blood chemistry
that is alien
and very likely toxic.
That story should hit the press.
It was just easier to kill Dr. Secare.
Of course.
Only one problem: he was Dr. Berube's old friend.
He was able to warn him.
There's just one thing I don't understand:
why you gave us so little to go on in the beginning.
And why are you giving us so much now?
I didn't anticipate the speed and precision
of their clean-up operation.
They're systematically destroying all the evidence--
Dr. Berube, the bodies here.
Without the evidence,
you two have no case.
Who would believe the story I just told you?
You must put together everything that you have found,
and you must find Dr. Secare before they do.
I'll have no further contact with you on this matter.
I'm going to get back to Georgetown
and get all the lab work.
I'm going to find Dr. Secare.
Where?
I don't know.
I'm going to trust my instincts.
Excuse me, I'm looking for Dr. Ann Carpenter.
I've been unable to reach her by phone,
and she's not in her office.
She was in a terrible car accident--
her whole family.
And Dr. Carpenter is, um, dead.
Dr. Secare?
Wait!
I'll protect you.
Your cellular phone's been ringing off the hook.
I'm a popular guy.
Why don't you answer it for me?
Oh, I don't like talking on the phone.
I have this thing about unsecured lines.
When you feel like talking, let me know, though.
He's not home.
Where is he?
He's been gone all night.
I wish I knew.
Something's happened to him.
They won't kill him.
How do you know that?
He's become too high-profile,
and you've got evidence that could expose them.
I don't have any evidence; they took the evidence,
and they may have killed in order to get it.
Listen to me.
Evidence still exists. Where?
It might be difficult to obtain,
but with your medical background,
I might be able to get you inside.
Inside where?
High containment facility,
Fort Marlene, Maryland.
What do they have there?
The wellspring, Miss Scully--
the original tissue.
If they've got Agent Mulder,
they might be willing to make a deal.
It could save his life.
Clear.
Name?
Dana Scully.
Company or institution?
Federal government.
Project password?
Project password?
Purity control.
Log in, please.
You're late.
Do you have it?
Yes.
Good.
They're willing to make the exchange.
You spoke to them?
Yes.
I'll take the parcel.
No, sir.
I'll make the exchange.
I made the deal, Scully.
They're expecting me.
I don't trust you.
You've got no one else to trust.
I don't know who you are.
I know nothing about you.
Oh, for God's sake,
don't screw this up!
Let me tell you something you should know.
In 1987, a group of children from a Southern state
were given what their parents thought
was a routine inoculation.
What they were injected with
was a clone DNA from the contents of that package
you're holding as a test.
That's the kind of people you're dealing with.
So, why give it back to them?
To save Mulder's life.
At the risk of so many other lives?
It's the tip of the iceberg.
You and Mulder are the only ones who can bring it to light.
Now, give me the parcel.
Give me the parcel, Scully.
No!
Mulder.
Trust...
no one.
Hello.
Hey, Scully, it's me.
Where are you?
They're shutting us down, Scully.
What?
They called me in tonight,
and they said they're going to reassign us to other sections.
Who told you that?
Skinner.
He said word came down from the top
of the executive branch.
Mulder...
It's over, Scully.
Well, you have to lodge a protest. They can't...
Yes, they can.
What are you going to do?
I'm...
...not going to give up.
I can't give up.
Not as long as the truth is out there.
I made this.

(Speaking Arabic)
(Screams)
(Military Radio Calls)
(Radio Static)
(Loud Hum)
(Explosion)
Oh, man!
This is Southern Crescent to Red Crescent.
We've got a downed plane at camp perimeter.
That's a negative.
We have nothing in the sky.
We got something down here.
Advise Medevac to stand by.
We're going to check it out.
Medevac One, Medevac One, this is Red Crescent.
Southern Crescent reports downed aircraft in their area. Over.
Breaker, breaker, this is Quick Light.
Anybody out there with their ears on?
Readin' you loud and clear. This is Betty Blue. Come on.
From Opryland, it's the Grand Ole Opry
on WSM Radio 650
brought toyou by Goody's Headache Powder.
When the night's been too long and the party's been too hearty,
Goody's Headache Powder will straighten you right out.
And you have myword on that. Goody--
(Loud Static)
C.B. Caller #1 : It was cigar-shaped, red and green lights
fast as hell.
Caller #2: I seen three ofthem fying over Chester County.
Caller #3: Right, right. Six troopers were chasing them down 22.
(Siren Blaring)
Caller #4: I see one now. It's over the water tower.
Red and green lights just likeyou said!
(Loud Hum)
From the trucker's description, the shape he fired upon
could conceivably have been a mountain lion's.
Conceivably.
The National Weather Service last night reported
atmospheric conditions in this area which were possibly
conducive to lightning.
Possibly.
It is feasible that the truck was struck by lightning
creating the electrical failure.
It's feasible.
And you know there's a marsh over there.
Those lights the driver saw may have been swamp gas.
Swamp gas?
It's a natural phenomenon in which phospine and methane
rising from decaying organic matter
ignite, creating globes ofblue fame.
Happens to me when I eat Dodger Dogs.
How can a dozen witnesses
including a squad ofpolice vehicles in three counties
become hysterical over swamp gas?
I've investigated multiple sightings before.
Chesapeake Bay, the Okoboji Lakes,
Area 51 in Nevada.
None had this much supporting evidence.
Anecdotal data, exhaust residue
radiation levels five times the norm.
Mulder, none ofthat evidence is conclusive.
The question is, whywas the trucker singled out?
Isn't it more plausible that an exhausted truck driver
became swept up in the hysteria and fired upon hallucinations?
After all, the road can play tricks on you.
Yeah, it can play tricks on you
but not like this.
I started these stop watches at the same time.
I don't know why they're holding me.
This "firing a weapon on a county road" charge
is a lot ofhorse manure.
I'm a vet and I know how to handle a gun.
Mr. Ranheim, I'd appreciate it ifyou could elaborate
on the reportyou filed last night regarding your encounter.
It was round...
Iike a saucer.
And green and orange lights.
Last nightyou said it was cigar-shaped and black.
I didn't ask for this to happen.
(Coughs)
All I want is to deliver my shipment ofauto parts and forget...
(Coughing)
Pardon me for asking,
but how long haveyou had that cough?
Why?
I'm just concerned. You said you were a veteran.
What's that got to do with this?
The cough, the fever, the rash.
Those are all symptoms ofGulfWar Syndrome.
I was never in the GulfWar.
Okay. So, how long haveyou not been yourself?
Since the thing last night.
Mr. Ranheim, I'm Police Chief Rivers.
Please, forgive the misunderstanding.
Your truck's been squared away. You may go.
I'd like to examine the truck.
That won't be necessary.
This man had an alleged close encounter.
The truck contains important evidence.
Sir! lfl may...
You've gotten all you're going to get.
We will no longer cooperate in your investigation.
Why?
just... go away.
Not... Not here.
It's obvious someone got to the police chief.
Ranheim was hiding something.
Ranheim was sick.
Only since last night.
Excuse me, could I useyour pen?
Mm-hmm.
You suggesting GulfWar Syndrome is caused by UFOs?
UFOs are frequentlywitnessed by soldiers during wartime.
Thanks.
Hereyou go.
The only UFOs that soldiers are likely to see
are secret military aircraft.
What ifthat's what made the soldiers in lraq sick--
the exhaust or fuel ofa classified aircraft or its weapon?
There is a base in Little Rock.
You think that's what the air force was fying that night?
They'd deny it, but it could explain how Ranheim developed his symptoms.
Possibly.
I want to talk to some people when we get back to Washington.
The military isn't going to talk.
No, these guys are like an extreme government watchdog group.
They publish a magazine called the Lone Gunman.
Some oftheir information is first-rate--
covert actions, classified weapons.
Some oftheir ideas are downright spooky.
(Clicking)
So, Mulder, I had breakfast
with the guywho shot john F. Kennedy.
Is that so?
Yeah. Says he was dressed as a cop on the grassy knoll.
Mulder, listen to this. Zhirinovsky, the leader ofthe Russian social democrats--
he's being put into power
by the most heinous and evil force ofthe 20th century.
Barney?
The C.I.A.
Hmm.
Is this your skeptical partner?
(Camera Clicks)
She's hot.
You don't believe the C.I.A., threatened by a loss ofpower and funding,
wouldn't dream ofhaving the old enemy back?
I thinkyou give the government too much credit.
The government can't control the deficit or manage crime.
Lone Gunman.
What makes you think they can plan and execute an elaborate conspiracy?
She is hot.
Settle down, Frohike.
It's not idiots on the hill trying to bone Capitol pages.
We're talking about a dark network--
a government within a government controlling our every move.
How can they do that?
How? I'll showyou how. You got a $20 bill?
Hmm.
I'll check.
Mm-hmm.
Hey!
That'sjust one method.
They use this magnetic strip to trackyou.
Wheneveryou go through a metal detector at an airport
they know exactly how much you're carrying.
It is a federal crime to deface money.
The strip is an anti-counterfeiting measure.
On the inside? Other countries put it on the outside.
O... O... Okay, all right.
What doyou know about GulfWar Syndrome?
Agent Orange ofthe '90s.
Shells coated with depleted uranium.
Heard ofany classified planes being fown during the Persian GulfWar?
Why expose secret planes to an air force that runs to lran wheneveryou fy?
Any UFO activity during that period?
Yeah. UFOs caused GulfWar Syndrome. That's a good one.
That's whywe likeyou, Mulder. Your ideas are weirder than ours.
Scully: Those were the most paranoid people I have ever met.
How could you think their ideas are remotely plausible?
I think it's remotely plausible that someone might thinkyou're hot.
Did you see the way they answered the telephone?
They probably think every call they get is monitored
and they're followed everywhere they go.
It's a form ofself-delusion.
It makes them think that what they're doing
is important enough that somebodywould...
What's the matter?
(Phone Ringing)
Hello.
(Hanging Up Telephone)
Pitchers and catchers report for spring training this week.
Yeah. What are we doing here?
Missed your calling, did you, Mr. Mulder?
Maybe this yearwe can catch a game at Camden Yards.
Ofcourse, we wouldn't be able to sit together.
That's too bad.
Something tells meyou'd have the connections to get great seats.
Any park in the country.
(Camera Clicks)
It'sjust a tourist.
In our line, nothing isjust what it seems.
What am I onto?
We go to investigate a truck driver's encounterwith a UFO
and the next thing we're discovering electronic surveillance equipment.
Who's listening to us?
Whywon'tyou tell me?
What am I onto?
A dangerous path.
(Man Speaking Arabic)
(Responding ln Arabic)
(Screams)
(First Man Speaking Excitedly)
(Yelling Response)
The truck is bogus
and so's the truck driver, Ranheim.
First I checked his manifest.
It listed a truck carrying 1 08 cartons ofauto parts
weighing 3,1 00 pounds.
Then I checked with three weigh stations along his route.
They have it listed at 5,1 00 pounds.
There's something in that truck, and it's not auto parts.
And ofcourse, nobody ever reported him.
Furthermore, Ranheim lied about being in the GulfWar.
His real name is Frank Druce.
And I worked hard to get this one--
He was special operations, black beret,
in Mosul, Northern lraq.
Also, he didn't get sick from the encounter the other night.
He's been to the V.A. hospital for treatments
three times in the pastyear.
We had it.
We had it, and we let it go.
Four days ago an lraqi Air Force pilot
shot down an unidentified fying object.
The wreckage and possibly the occupants were recovered by the army.
Ranheim, the truck driver, would be a perfect escort
for the wreckage and/or bodies
out oflraq to a laboratory in the United States.
That would explain why the truck weighs so much more than listed.
The military has, in the past,
transported dangerous materials and weapons...
in unmarked trucks across the country.
I'm beginning to sound like those guys at the Lone Gunman, right?
Where did you obtain this information?
Let'sjust say it's a source with a deep background.
I want to know all about him.
All I know is that he's guided us away from harm.
How doyou know that?
We work for the Federal Bureau of lnvestigation, and we're being bugged.
What does that tell you?
That tells me that not everything is as it appears to be.
Exactly.
For all we know, this deep background is responsible for the bug.
He's never lied to me.
I won't break that confidence.
I trust him.
Mulder, you're the only one I trust.
Then you're going to have to trust me.
Did you find out where the truck is now?
Generally.
It's heading west, towards Colorado.
We've got to try to intercept it and see what's on board.
I'm going to go pick up a few things.
I'll meetyou back atyour place in an hour, okay?
I cut the main breaker.
(Sighs)
You risk exposure coming here.
What I have here is too important.
The photograph in that envelope
was taken by an officer at Fort Benning, Georgia.
1 7 UFOs were spotted in one hour.
Is that where the lraqi wreckage is being held?
Are UFOs monitoring the area?
Nice placeyou have here.
Wait. Wait.
I just wanted to take this opportunity to thankyou.
You've helped mywork so much
and you've never asked for anything in return
and I knowyou've putyourself at great risk to do so.
This is the best photographic evidence I have ever seen.
I knew the Gulf Breeze photos were a hoax,
but this is the quality ofevidence the government has amassed for decades
at the highest classified levels.
That business with the truckwas a decoy
to keep anyone looking closely away from Fort Benning
where they are keeping the remains ofthe lraqi UFO.
We've got to leave for Georgia immediately.
This photograph is a fake.
What?
Look.
This soldier's shadow is allegedly created by the lights from the UFO,
but it falls in a direction contradictory to the craft's position.
There could be an off-camera light source creating that shadow.
Look closely at the color ofthe light refected in the windshield.
It should be from the red lights ofthe UFO
but it doesn't match the color ofthe ship's lights.
There's probably tint in the windshield.
Or the gradation could be attributed to atmospheric conditions.
We should have it analyzed.
You're determined not to believe him.
Maybeyou're too determined to believe him.
I am determined to follow a lead
that may result in the proofofthe existence
ofextraterrestrial biological entities.
Mulder, listen. Please, will youjust hear me?
I have never met anyone
so passionate and dedicated to a beliefas you.
It's so intense that sometimes it's blinding.
But there are others who are watching you who know what I know.
And whereas I can respect and admireyour passion,
theywill use it againstyou.
Mulder, the truth is out there, but so are lies.
Thankyou.
I had the photo analyzed by the Bureau's computers.
Initially, it appears to be legitimate.
The film grain matches in pattern and density,
color levels, shading.
Then I noticed this.
It's the moon, halffull.
I had the refection in this window enlarged by 25.
There's the moon again, a quarter full--
not to mention that the window couldn't even catch the moon's refection
from that angle.
You were right, Scully.
It's a fake.
He tried to deceive us.
Now we're alone on this.
There's no one we can trust.
Theywent to a lot oftrouble to put us on the wrong track.
There's something here that no one's supposed to find.
Why didn'tyou leave for Fort Benning?
The photograph was a fake.
Well, at leastyou're not insulting me further by feigning appalled surprise.
I think a compliment is in order.
That photo was prepared by ourvery best.
I thoughtyou were my ally.
Oh, I am.
Imagine if Eisenhower told the Allies D-Daywould take place in Belgium.
I place my life in greatjeopardy every time we speak.
I've been a participant in some ofthe most insidious lies...
and witness to deeds that no crazed man could imagine.
I spentyears watching you...
from my, uh, lofty position
to know thatyou were the one I could trust.
- Then why did you lie to me? - To divertyou.
You and Scully are excellent investigators
and your motives arejust.
However, there still exist some secrets
which should remain secret--
truths that people arejust not ready to know.
Who areyou to decide that for me?
The world's reaction to such knowledge would be far too dangerous.
Dangerous. You mean, in the sense ofoutrage,
Iike the reaction to the Kennedy assassination or M.I.A.s
or radiation experiments on terminal patients, Watergate,
Iran-Contra, Roswell, the Tuskegee experiments.
Where will it end?
Oh, I guess it won't end as long as...
men likeyou decide what is truth.
That transcriptyou gave me ofthe lraqi pilot-- that was the truth.
Yeah.
Why did you even bother to show it to me?
Well, I was aware thatyou were onto the truck
so I knew that down the road I would have to steeryou away,
that I would have to lie toyou,
and a lie, Mr. Mulder,
is most convincingly hidden between two truths.
Mulder.
Ifa shark stops swimming, it will die.
Don't stop swimming.
I'm not responsible for the electronic surveillance
but I do know they can still hearyou.
(Doorbell Rings)
Scully: Mulder!
Areyou home?
Scully, glad you dropped by.
I been thinking about this whole situation.
And I thinkyou're right.
I thinkwe shouldjust move on.
I think this time you're right, Mulder.
All right, stickwith him.
Hey!
There is your round-trip ticket to Chicago.
Here's your credit card.
And the plane departs at gate 35.
I'd also like a one-way ticket to Los Angeles
with a stop in Las Vegas, and I'll be paying cash.
(Horns Honking)
Called everyweigh station and bureau office west ofColorado.
Tied up an airphone for three hours.
SomeJapanese businessman told me to stick a piece ofsushi
where the sun don't shine.
My ear's numb from being on hold for so many hours.
At least they didn't trace our call.
I couldn't find the truck. Did you have any luck?
Yep. It's heading northwest on l-90.
We have to get a couple oftickets to Seattle.
Yeah, think about it.
This truck drove across America.
People it passed probably thought it was hauling auto parts or furniture,
Iivestock, whatever.
Nobodywould have suspected it was hauling a craft from anotherworld.
Here we go.
Mulder, we've been following this truck for hours.
Maybe he knows we're following him and he's taking an evasive route.
Well, ifthat were the case...
(Loud Static)
You all right?
Yeah.
Come on.
Scully: Ranheim!
Ranheim?
Scully!
Scully: Oh, my God.
It was an extraterrestrial biological entity... alive.
Where did it go?
I thinkwe werejust witness to a rescue mission.
God, Mulder, I can't stop shaking.
Whatjust happened-- does it fit the profile?
Areyou asking me ifit was real?
Did wejust have a close encounter?
No. It was another hoax.
But how could anyone generate such force?
Whatever they used, we probably haven't heard ofit.
Sound weapons, a stealth helicopter with an ultra high-intensity light.
It doesn't matter. There's no evidence that this was a UFO.
So they created this elaborate show just to defect us again?
Wouldn't it have been easier for them just...
just to kill us.
Yeah, I've wondered that myself.
Maybe they're using me against myself, likeyou said before.
That I want so badly to believe,
that I'djust accept the obvious conclusions and walk away.
Well, now we have nothing to go on
and no one to turn to.
There's still one player in all this who hasn't lied to us,
but it's not quite someone we can turn to.
Leverling and Priest Rapids,
east bank ofthe Columbia River.
Did you send out a field investigator?
And you can substantiate the sighting?
Okay, Nick. Thanks a lot.
I've contacted several organizations that have hot lines for UFO reports.
Center for UFO Studies in Chicago,
MUFON, NICAP...
None ofthem have ever reported a week ofsuch activity.
It began in Tennessee where Ranheim was encountered.
The sightings are following the path ofthe truck.
And after last night's hoax...
Look at this.
Seven sightings in Mattawa, Washington, a hundred miles away.
Aliens?
Looks like theywant their colleague back.
We've driven full circle through Mattawa twice.
There's nothing here.
(Rock Music)
What's over there?
Man: We have been waiting!
Welcome to our home!
We are willing to go with you!
Freddie: Ahh-doo-nay-vah-so-barahgahs.
That's an intergalactic space greeting.
That means " Hello, space brothers."
- Hello. - What's going on here?
A UFO party.
You've seen UFOs?
Last two nights. They're drawn to our electric power.
They hover over the power plant down there.
Man: Everyone! They are here!
Yes, sir, that's right.
It's all secure. Lock it up.
Mulder: This is it.
There's Ranheim.
This place has got to have the highest level ofsecurity.
just the kind ofchallenge they're looking for.
Who?
(Dialing Phone)
(Phone Ringing)
Lone Gunman.
It's Mulder. Turn the tape recorder off.
Okay. It's off.
- Turn it off!. - It's offalready.
How would you like to have on your front page
the first substantiated photo of an extraterrestrial biological entity?
No way. An E.B.E.? What do we have to do?
just hack me some identification numbers.
Mulder: Braidwood and Stefoff.
Personal identification number?
7-5-9-3.
5-3-1 -1 .
Open the trunk, please.
Park in lot four.
Thanks.
Hey, wait!
Display these at all times.
Proceed.
Langly said he couldn't gain access to level six, so that's whywe...
We have to go back through that door.
We'll look suspicious going back.
We'll have to find another access then.
Theywon't let us.
You folks come with me, please.
We're lost. We're looking for...
-Just proceed down the hallway. - Ifyou couldjust help us...
Mulder, stop.
We're agents with the Federal Bureau oflnvestigation.
I'm reaching for my l.D.
We're here conducting an investigation.
Proceed down the hallway, please.
This is level two to level six.
I have a male and a female who have identified themselves...
- Mulder! - Stop!
Hold it!
He took the stairs!
Go! Go! Go!
This way.
Come on, guys!
Aah!
Stay on top ofhim!
Move! Move!
Man: Halt!
I said, hold it!
Halt!
(Guns Cocking)
Deep Throat: Let him go.
Let him go!
You've done well.
You're dismissed.
I know how badly,
how... very badlyyou want to look through that window.
But it would be pointless.
It's dead.
After the Roswell incident in 1 947,
even at the brink ofthe Cold War
there was an ultrasecret conference
attended by the United States, the Soviet Union,
the People's Republic ofChina, Britain,
both Germanies, France,
and it was agreed that should any extraterrestrial biological entity
survive a crash,
the country that held that being would be responsible
for its extermination.
I, um... have the distinction ofbeing one ofthree men
to have exterminated such a creature.
I was with the C.I.A. in Vietnam.
A UFO was sighted for five nights over Hanoi.
The Marines shot it down and brought it to us.
Maybe... it didn't know what a gun was
or perhaps they don't show emotion...
but that... innocent and blank expression
as I pulled the trigger has haunted me...
until I found you.
That's why I come toyou, Mr. Mulder,
and will continue to come toyou to...
atone forwhat I've done.
And maybe sometime
through you,
the truth will be known.
You're awfully quiet, Mr. Mulder.
I'm wondering which lie to believe.
(Chuckles)

We got a fire offcounty road D-7
two miles west of the Canyon Ridge intersection.
Suggest we dispatch fire crews. Over.
(static)
This is DeputyWright.
Doyou copy?
Son ofa...
Sir?
Sorry to disturbyou, sir
but we've picked up an unidentified bogey.
l thinkyou should see the replay foryourself.
lt tripped the fence at 231 7
offConnecticut's coast.
lnitial trajectory, north by northwest.
then it went crazy.
Any other aircraft in the area?
No known aircraft can maneuver like this.
Well, whatever it was
dropped offthe screen at 241 8, sir.
Hit ground west of Lake Michigan
outside Townsend, Wisconsin.
The tracking prediction team
calculated impact at over 800
miles per hour.
l've instructed Chief Koretz
to start her report...
Negative.
She tracked a meteor.
lt's aberrant movement
was due to instrument malfunction.
But, sir...
Your report will refect these facts.
ls that clear?
Yes, sir.
Good.
Code lndigo-Delta-Echo-Niner.
l have a confirmed fallen angel in sector 87.
Mobilize Operation Falcon immediately.
Wright: Hello?
(screaming)
Reporter: Theywill have no comment
until the government investigation now underway
is completed.
Government officials remain vague
about the toxic cargo that has caused the immediate evacuation
ofTownsend, Wisconsin's, 1 2,000 residents.
Speculation here has centered on
a shipment oftoxic waste.
by an electronic fence that reaches 1 5,000 miles
into space.
We use it to track and monitor
the 7,087 man-made objects that orbit the earth.
Last night at 231 7 that fence was breached.
This morning at 01 00
Operation Falcon went into effect
led by Colonel Calvin Henderson
the Air Force's reclamations expert.
Reclamations?
During the Cold War, hisjob
was to prevent technologies from downed U.S. aircraft
from getting into Soviet hands.
He's part ofa crash retrieval unit.
Mm-hmm.
Quick response.
l'd sayyou have 24 hours
before the entire area is sanitized.
After that, it would be like nothing ever happened.
Man: Alright, get the trucks rolling.
Man: Keep 'emgoing!
(chattering)
(soldiers chattering)
(helicopter whirring)
Thankyou, sir.
Thankyou.
Get 'er rolling. Let's go! Let's go!
Soldier: Alright, clear the road!
You're late, lieutenant.
lt will be dark in a halfhour.
We had a fat, sir.
There's a briefing at 2200 hours.
Go to headquarters for live rounds.
Live rounds, sir?
You got a problem with that?
We were told this was a drill.
They told you wrong.
Sir.
Okay, everyone out!
Come on, people, light a fire!
(indistinctchattering)
Man: Uh, roger, this is Charley-Delta-SevenSquad.
We're continuing thesearch, butat this time, it'snegative.
(men yelling)
(whooshing noises)
(shutter clicking)
(shutter clicking rapidly)
Youjust made the worst mistake
ofyour life, Agent Mulder.
l thinkyou knocked out a filling.
You'll pay the price
for putting my men at risk.
Since when does taking pictures put lives at risk?
You violated a U.S. Government quarantine
and that's a federal crime.
A quarantine?
That's whatyou call this?
We're trying to contain an ecological disaster.
That's a lot offirepower to protect Mother Nature.
l have my orders
and the license to execute them as l see fit.
l suggest you forget whatyou saw
orwhatyou thinkyou saw
foryour own well-being.
You've got a downed craft in those woods, sir
and troops carrying live rounds.
We both know what's out there!
Areyou MUFON or KUFOS?
Doyou mind ifl sit down?
Let me guess.
You're wh that new group, CSlCOP, right?
Say no more. You're a cautious man.
Trust no one-- verywise.
Afterwhat happened toJ.F.K., l understand completely.
Let me introduce myself.
My name is Max Fenig.
l'm with the National lnvestigative Committee
ofAerial Phenomenon-- NlCAP.
Pleased... pleased to makeyour acquaintance.
l wish we could shake on it, you know.
Firm grip, look right in the eye--
you learn a lot about a guy that way.
Can l, um..?
Can l askyou a question?
Go ahead.
Did you see anything?
Did you get close?
Me, l saw nothing.
l didn't see anything!
Nada, zip.
A hundred yards past the roadblock
they nailed me.
l have no idea how they did it.
l'm telling you
it's like the Roswell cover-up all over again.
What makes you so sure there's something out there?
Same thing that makes you so sure?
l didn't order room service.
This isn't funny, Mulder.
Did you meet Max?
Who?
Max from NlCAP.
Oh. They must have released him.
Another intrepid soul in search ofa close encounter.
ls that what this is about?
What else?
Try explaining that to Section Chief McGrath.
He's ordering a full inquiry
with a recommendation...
Mulder, he wants to shut down the X-Files
and he wants you out ofthe Bureau.
What else is new?
l don't understand you, Mulder--
whyyou're always defying protocol
ignoringjurisdiction.
Because l know what l saw, Scully.
There weren't train tracks anywhere near that site.
So how could it have been a derailed container?
Because it wasn't.
Whatyou saw was not a toxic spill.
But it wasn't a U.F.O., either.
Okay, l'm all ears. what was it?
lt was a downed Libyanjet with a nuclearwarhead.
(chuckling)
Over U.S. airspace?
They've been picking up radiation
indicating that the plutonium casing
may have cracked.
So to avoid mass panic...
You really believe that story?
That story happens to be highly classified.
A highly classified lie.
(helicopterwhirring)
They're searching for someone, Scully.
Probably the pilot.
You think they'd roll out all this material
for one Libyan fighterjock?
Besides, no human pilot walked away from that wreckage.
Well, maybe he ejected.
Maybe.
Scully: You can't be serious.
As long as we're here in Townsend, why not?
The hearing is tomorrow morning.
That gives us 24 hours to investigate.
My assignment is to bring you back--
not to helpyou dig yourselfin deeper.
The LastDetail starring Dana Scully.
(phone offthe hook)
What's going on?
Looks like housekeeping hasn't been hereyet.
Who would..?
(banging)
Shh.
(banging)
Max?
Getyour hands up!
Whoa, don't shoot! Don't shoot!
Max?
Ahem.
My apologies.
Forgive me.
l'm a curious man.
l had to know.
Know what?
lfit was reallyyou.
You don't know me.
Wejust met last night.
We at NlCAP have been following your career closely
sinceyour involvement with X-Files.
Following my career? How?
The Freedom oflnformation Act.
Your travel expenses
are a matter ofpublic record.
So this must be the enigmatic Agent Scully.
How did you recognize me?
l sawyour picture in a trade publication once
and l read your article in Omni about the Gulf Breeze Sightings.
l published that under a pseudonym.
M.F. Luder. l know.
lt's an anagram for F. Mulder.
You really didn't think that would fool us, did you?
l didn't think anybody was paying attention.
Somebody is always paying attention, Mr. Mulder.
Amazing.
Amazing? Hardly.
You want to see something amazing
come with me.
Enigmatic Dr. Scully.
This is my, uh...
Right this way.
Excuse the mess.
Okay.
Where's those, uh...
Let me turn this off.
Theywere right here.
Oh, here they are.
The latest crop circle photos from Project Argus. Huh?
Your opinion-- fact or fraud?
Mulder: Fraud.
or a systematic reaction by the plant tissue
to being lodged in one position.
Max: You've read the literature.
Mulder: l try to keep up.
You said you had something to show us.
Oh, yeah. The Wolfs Ear 2000.
Ever hear ofthis?
Yeah. Wolfindustries supplies the C.l.A.
with all ofits surveillance equipment.
State-of-the-art search and intercept--
up to 1 00 channels per second.
l'm jacked into local fire and police departments
cellular phone pathways
and when the weather's right
air traffic control from Whitmarsh air force base.
What haveyou got, Max?
Mobile unit broadcast in scan mode
Townsend Sheriffs Department two nights ago.
We got a fire offcounty road D-7
two miles west
ofthe Canyon Ridge intersection.
Suggest we dispatch fire crews. Over.
This is DeputyWright.
Doyou copy?
And then this, 35 minutes later
presumably from the fire crew.
Reception got wiggy for some reason.
This is Unit 53.
Man down. Request medevac.
l said request medevac.
You're breaking up. Barely... bad...
Very bad. Wait a second.
What the hell?
Charlie, we got a situation here.
We put up a tight net.
Yes, sir, every inch ofground is being covered
dug up, squeezed, and sifted.
No, sir. lt will not get away.
Not this time.
Mrs. Wright?
Hi. l'm Fox Mulder.
This is Dana Scully.
We're from the F.B.l.
We'd like to askyou aboutyour husband.
He's dead.
What else is there to know?
l'm sorry aboutyour husband.
Oh, please.
Mrs. Wright, we want to helpyou.
Then leave me alone.
Let us helpyou.
l don't know anything.
Don'tyou understand?
Theywon't even release the body
so l can give him a proper burial, okay?
The government can't do that.
l'm sure ifwe appealed...
No! You can't.
You're entitled to the truth.
l can't afford the truth.
They said ifl spoke to anyone
theywould withhold my husband's pension
and l have a child to take care of.
(static screeching)
Picking up extremely high frequency signal--
200,000 megahertz.
Sir, target
on the northeast side.
foot speed--
seven miles per hour, sir.
Beta team...
Copy.
Target entering your section from the southwest.
Search and destroy.
Repeat-- search and destroy.
Yes, sir.
jackson?
Nothing.
Must have been an animal.
l'm sorry, but unless you have a subpoena
l can't discuss patient information.
Does that meanJason Wright was your patient?
lt means l have nothing more to say.
What about to his wife and child, Doctor?
Would you have anything to say to them?
Because whoever got toyou also got to her.
They must have made some pretty big threats.
What did they hold overyour head--
your medical license, the l.R.S.?
l hate fascists.
Excuse me?
The men who came in here--
The way they pushed us all around.
Dr. Oppenheim, tell us about the deputy.
You saw him that night
didn'tyou?
Yes.
And three others from a fire crew.
Theywere all D.O.A. with fifth- and sixth-degree burns
over 90% oftheir bodies.
But theyweren't like any burns l've ever seen.
They took the bodies away
before we could perform any pathology.
Did you note any cadaveric heat rigor or stiffening?
Quite a bit offexion in the limbs.
How doyou know so much about it?
l did my residency in forensic medicine.
ln your opinion
could those burns have been caused by ionizing radiation?
Well, l hadn't thought.
l suppose it's possible
ifthe exposure was sufficiently intense.
Let's say those men died from radiation exposure.
Couldn't it have been from the cracked core
ofa nuclearwarhead?
l've read about these kinds ofburns.
So have l-- in Hiroshima at ground zero.
l'm talking about close encounter mortalities.
l have a stack ofX-Files reporting the same results.
l don't claim to know all the answers
but ifwe don't make the O.P.R. inquest
by tomorrow morning
there may not be any more X-Files.
(moaning)
(moaning)
Start an l.V. here, stat.
Mulder: Tell us what happened.
Whatever happened has nothing to do with you.
Wrong, Colonel.
We want the same thing, onlyyou want it dead.
Can'tyou see that chasing it down
leaves it no choice but to defend itself?
How many more have to die before you rethinkyour approach?
Listen to me
'cause l'm not wasting another breath on this.
lfyou and your partner
aren't out ofhere in 30 seconds...
Agent Scully stays here.
We're undermanned, she's a doctor-- she stays.
lfthat's okay.
Ofcourse.
lfyou don't mind
youjust take care ofmy men
and let me do mywork.
Outside this emergency room you can do whateveryou want
but in here l call the shots--
assuming, ofcourse
you want me to take care ofyour men.
Get this man
out ofmy sight.
Where do l scrub up?
Max.
Hey, Max.
Max.
Hey... Max.
Who are... who areyou?
Max, it's me, Fox Mulder.
You okay?
What areyou doing here?
You were having some kind ofseizure.
Seizure?
That's impossible.
You were lying on the foor unconscious, convulsing.
That's odd.
l haven't had an episode in seven years--
not since l went on medication.
Let's getyou to the hospital.
No.
l mean, l mean it's not necessary.
You sure?
Yeah. l lived with epilepsy all my life.
l'm not in any danger.
Yeah, it started in South Dakota
when l was ten.
The doctor said l must have incurred a head injury.
l don't remember ever hitting my head.
You have no memory ofyour seizures?
As a kid l used to wake up in strange places
with no idea where l was or how l got there.
(sighs)
Sorry. l...
l got to, l got to go to sleep.
All right.
(sighing)
Rough night, huh?
lt was terrible.
We lost all but two
and they're still in critical condition
on theirway to the burn unit
atJohns Hopkins.
So what doyou think, Scully?
What's going on out there?
l don't know, and under other circumstances
l would like to find out
but we have a plane to catch injust over an hour.
l wantyou to take a look at something first.
What?
Max.
There's an unusual incision behind his left ear.
l've seen this incision twice before.
Two women-- a thousand miles apart
no way ofknowing each other, no relation.
both claim to have been abducted by aliens.
areyou saying Max Fenig is an abductee?
Mulder
the man is taking powerful antipsychotic drugs.
l saw them in his R.V.
They're for his epilepsy.
Dilantin is an anti-convulsant
but Mellaril is used exclusively to treat schizophrenia.
More than likely, Max is delusional.
You don't seem to understand, Scully.
Max doesn't believe he was abducted by aliens.
l believe he was.
Now, could you at least take a look at the scar
and give meyour medical opinion?
Okay.
You pack.
l'll take a look at Max on the way to the airport.
Sir, l have fash traffic at 24-1 8.
Repeated calls for l.D. go unanswered
and it's not in the orbital or sub-orbital inventory.
24-1 8-- isn't that where..?
Same exact spot, sir
though l am reading a much larger craft.
Meteor, Ms. Koretz.
A much larger meteor, sir.
Hold on a second.
We have a confirm.
Whitmarsh Air Force Base is tracking.
Where is it?
Well, sir, the meteor seems to be hovering
over a small town in eastern Wisconsin.
Come on, Mulder, let's get this overwith.
Hey, Max.
Max.
Max?
Hey, Max.
Max?
Mulder, look at this.
Mulder: What is that? Blood?
Man:Falcon Patrol reporting unidentifiedtrespass.
Mulder!
Come on.
Where doyou think you're going?
lfwe go to the airport now, we might make the plane
which would giveyou halfa chance
ofdefending yourself.
Think about it.
Max is a gypsy, nomad, right?
Yes. So what?
He intercepted Wright's last call
to his dispatcher
which means he was here in Townsend, Wisconsin
the night ofthe crash.
Ofall the places he could have been, he was here.
lf Max was abducted
that would go a long way
to explaining his obsessions.
lfwe figure that out, you can be sure Henderson has.
Doyou have the keys?
(panting)
Don't do this.
Sir, we've apprehended the target, a civilian.
Negative, Falcon patrol.
Take him with extreme caution.
They're dead.
(Max groaning)
Max: lt hurts. Stop.
Why? Why? Why?
lt hurts.
Max?
lt hurts.
Stop. lt hurts.
lt hurts. lt hurts.
lt's all right.
Stop it!
...lt hurts.
No, no, it's me they...
They're coming for me.
No, l know that...
that's why they're here.
They're coming for me.
(helicopterwhirring)
lt hurts.
(moaning)
Alpha team, secure the roof.
Hold it right there!
Putyour hands up and come with us!
Alpha team, ready on the roof.
Roger, Alpha. Delta team, report.
Delta team in position, sir.
What areyou doing?
You have a very sick man in there.
We're not in the hospital now, Dr. Scully.
Omega team, report.
He's a delusional schizophrenic.
Keep her clear.
Sir, this is Alpha team leader.
l'm picking up three forms inside the structure.
That's affirmative.
Two are proximate
the third approaching from 40 meters.
All teams prepare for go in 30 seconds.
Come on. Come on, Max.
Why... stop. Why...
l'm here to helpyou.
l'm scared.
l know.
Don't let them take me.
Mulder: l won't let them takeyou.
Come on, Max.
Come with me.
No!
Max!
Max!
Max!
Max!
Sir, this is Alpha team leader.
Except for our men
l'm only picking up one figure inside.
l do not copy that.
We indicate only one figure
inside the building.
What?
Soldier: Blow the door!
Take him!
(soldiers chattering)
That's your unit, sir.
Where is he?
He's gone. They got to him first.
They beat us, Colonel.
Arrest him.
And keep looking.
Agent Scully
to the best ofyour knowledge, was Agent Mulder ever assigned
to investigate matters related to the evacuation
ofTownsend, Wisconsin?
No, sir.
At any time
wereyou aware ofhis submitting a Form 302
requesting said assignment or travel expenses?
No, sir.
While in Wisconsin
did Agent Mulder drive a blue Ford Taurus
registered to the State Car rental agency?
Yes, sir.
Thankyou, Agent Scully.
Sir, request permission to make a statement.
Request denied.
Sir, it's unfair tojudge Mulder by the same criteria...
You're dismissed.
But, sir...
That will be all.
You hear that noise, Scully?
Hammer and nails.
They're building a gallows in the town square.
Don't worry.
lt was only a matter oftime.
l'm surprised l lasted this long.
Good luck.
l'll break a leg.
McGrath: ...as well as insubordination and misconduct.
How doyou respond to these allegations, Agent Mulder?
Over a dozen men lost their lives
and you want me to respond to issues ofprotocol?
You failed to obtain proper authorization foryour actions.
l knew it wouldn't be forthcoming.
You also violated a Federal quarant...
A cover-up was underway...
Exposing yourself and possibly others
to toxic contamination!
Oh, toxic contamination. Are we back in that?
You read my report.
Explain Max Fenig's disappearance.
Your report is not the subject ofthis inquiry.
X rays taken while Mr. Fenig was institutionalized
showed an object lodged in his cerebellum.
That is irrelevant, Agent Mulder.
The man was abducted.
Everybody in this room knows it.
Colonel Henderson's written testimony states
that Fenig's body was found two hours later
in a cargo container.
Then what can l say?
How can l disprove lies that are stamped
with an official seal?
That will be all, Mr. Mulder.
(sighing)
You can deny all the things l've seen
all the things l've discovered, but not for much longer
'cause too many know what's happening out there
and no one, no government agency
hasjurisdiction over the truth.
Why did you countermand our decision?
Mulder's conduct was in clearviolation
not only of Bureau procedures, but of Federal Law.
Yes.
l don't understand.
The committee's case was airtight.
You've ruined the last best chance we had
to get rid ofhim.
l appreciate your frustration
butyou and l both know that Mulder's work--
his, uh... singular passion--
poses a most unique dilemma
but his occasional insubordination
is in the end far less dangerous.
With respect, sir--
less dangerous than what?
Than having him exposed to the wrong people--
what he knows...
what he thinks he knows.
(sighing)
Always keepyour friends close, Mr. McGrath
but keepyour enemies closer.

ï»¿1 Base this is patrol six
Negative on object. Are your bearings correct?
It was there a second ago.
YOU'RE UNDER ATTACK!!
I'M LOCKED IN!
IT'S A HIT! I GOT HIM!
Oh, man.
This is Southern Crescent to Red Crescent.
We've got a downed plane at camp perimeter.
Southern Crescent, this is Red Crescent.
That's a negative. We have nothing in the sky at this time.
Well, we got something down here.
Advise medevac unit to be on standby.
We're going to check it out.
Roger.
Medevac 1, Medevac 1, this is Red Crescent...
...downed aircraft in their area. Over.
From Opryland, it's The Grand Ole Opry
on WSM Radio 650,
brought to you by Goody's Headache Powder.
When the night's been too long and the party's been
too hearty, Goody's Headache Powder
will straighten you right out,
and you have my word on that.
Goody...
It was, it was cigar-shaped,
red and green lights, fast as hell.
I seen three of 'em flying over Chester County.
Right, right,
six troopers were chasing 'em down 22.
Whoa, I see one now.
It's over the water tower.
I see it, too.
Red and green lights just like you said.
From the trucker's description, the shape he fired upon
could conceivably have been a mountain lion's.
Conceivably.
The National Weather Service last night reported
atmospheric conditions in this area which were possibly
conducive to lightning.
Possibly.
It is feasible that the truck
was struck by lightning,
creating the electrical failure.
It's feasible.
And you know there's a marsh over there.
Those lights the driver saw
may... have been swamp gas.
Swamp gas?
It's a natural phenomenon
in which phosphine and methane
rising from decaying organic matter
ignite, creating globes of blue flame.
Happens to me when I eat Dodger Dogs.
How can a dozen witnesses, including a squad
of police vehicles in three counties,
become hysterical over swamp gas?
I've investigated multiple sightings before.
Chesapeake Bay, the Okoboji Lakes,
Area 51 in Nevada.
None had this much supporting evidence.
Anecdotal data, exhaust residue,
radiation levels five times the norm.
Mulder, none of that evidence is conclusive.
The only question for me is,
why was the truck driver singled out?
Isn't it more plausible that an exhausted truck driver
became swept up in the hysteria and fired upon hallucinations?
I mean, after all,
the road can play tricks on you.
Yeah, it can play tricks on you.
But not like this.
I started these stopwatches at the same time.
I don't know why they're holding me.
This "firing a weapon on a county road" charge
is a lot of horse manure.
I'm a vet and I know how to handle a gun.
Mr. Ranheim, I'd appreciate it
if you could elaborate
on the report you filed last night
regarding your encounter.
It was round...
...like a saucer.
And green and orange lights.
Last night you said it was cigar-shaped and black.
I didn't ask for this to happen.
All I want is to deliver my shipment
of auto parts and forget...
Pardon me for asking,
but how long have you had that cough?
Why?
I'm just concerned.
You said you were a veteran.
What's that got to do with this?
The cough, the fever, the rash.
Those are all symptoms of Gulf War Syndrome.
I was never in the Gulf War.
Okay. So, how long have you not been yourself?
Since the thing last night.
Mr. Ranheim, I'm Police Chief Rivers.
Please forgive the misunderstanding.
Your truck's been squared away.
You may go.
I'd like to examine the truck.
That won't be necessary.
This man has had an alleged close encounter.
The truck undoubtedly contains important trace evidence.
Sir, if I may...
You've gotten all you're going to get out of this county.
We will no longer cooperate in your investigation.
Why?
Just... go away.
Not... not here.
It's obvious someone got to the police chief.
Ranheim was hiding something.
Ranheim was sick.
He only became sick last night.
Excuse me, could I use your pen?
Mm-hmm.
What are you suggesting,
that Gulf War Syndrome is caused by UFOs?
UFOs are frequently witnessed
by soldiers during wartime.
Thanks.
Here you go. Oh, thank you.
Mulder, the only UFOs that soldiers are likely to see
are secret military aircraft.
Well, what if that's what made the soldiers
in Iraq sick-- the exhaust or fuel
of a classified aircraft or its weapon?
Well, there is a base in Little Rock.
You think that's what the air force was flying that night?
They'd deny it, but it could possibly explain how Ranheim
developed his symptoms.
Possibly.
I want to talk to some people
when we get back to Washington.
Mulder, the military isn't going
to talk about classified info.
No, these guys are like
an extreme government watchdog group.
They publish a magazine called The Lone Gunman.
Some of their information is first-rate--
covert actions, classified weapons.
Some of their ideas are downright spooky.
Check it out, Mulder, I had breakfast
with the guy who shot John F. Kennedy.
Is that so?
Old dude now, but yeah.
Says he was dressed as a cop on the grassy knoll.
And, Mulder, listen to this.
Vladimir Zhirinovsky,
the leader of the Russian Social Democrats--
he's being put into power
by the most heinous and evil force of the 20th century.
Barney?
The CIA.
Hmm.
Is this your skeptical partner?
She's hot.
You don't believe that the CIA,
threatened by a loss of power and funding
because of the collapse of the Cold War,
wouldn't dream of having the old enemy back?
I think you give the government too much credit.
I mean, the, the government
can't control the deficit or manage crime.
Lone Gunman. What makes you think
they can plan and execute such an elaborate conspiracy?
She is hot.
Settle down, Frohike.
We're not talking about a bunch of idiots up on the Hill
trying to bone the Capitol pages.
We're talking about a dark network--
a government within a government controlling our every move.
How can they do that? How?
I'll show you how.
You got a $20 bill?
Hmm.
I'll check.
That's just one method.
They use this magnetic strip to track you.
Whenever you go through a metal detector at an airport,
they know exactly how much you're carrying
it is a federal crime to deface money.
on the inside? Other countries put that strip on the outside.
What are they hiding? O-O-O-Okay, all right.
What do you know about the Gulf War Syndrome?
Agent Orange of the '90s.
Artillery shells coated with depleted uranium.
Have you heard of any classified planes
being flown during the Persian Gulf War?
Why would you need to expose a secret plane to an air force
that runs to Iran whenever you take to the air?
What about UFO activity during that period?
Yeah.
UFOs caused the Gulf War Syndrome.
That's a good one.
That's why we like you, Mulder.
Your ideas are weirder than ours.
Those were the most paranoid people I have ever met.
I don't know how you could think
that what they say is even remotely plausible.
I think it's remotely plausible
that someone might think you're hot.
Did you see the way they answered the telephone?
They probably think that every call they get is monitored
and they're followed everywhere they go.
It's a form of self-delusion.
It makes them think that what they're doing
is important enough that somebody would...
What's the matter?
Hello.
Pitchers and catchers report
for spring training this week.
Yeah, what are we doing here?
Missed your calling, did you, Mr. Mulder?
Yeah, maybe this year we can catch a game
at Camden Yards.
Of course we wouldn't be able to sit together.
That's too bad.
Something tells me you'd have the connections
to get great seats.
Yeah, any park in the country.
It's just a tourist.
In our line
nothing is just what it seems.
What am I onto?
We go down to investigate a truck driver's encounter
with a UFO, and the next thing,
we're discovering electronic surveillance equipment.
Who's listening to us?
Why won't you tell me?
What am I onto?
A dangerous path.
The truck is bogus and so is the truck driver Ranheim.
First I checked his manifest.
It listed a truck carrying 108 cartons of auto parts,
weighing 3,100 pounds.
Then I checked with three weigh stations along his route,
and they have it listed at 5,100 pounds.
There's something in that truck, Mulder, and it's not auto parts,
and of course nobody ever reported him.
Furthermore, Ranheim lied to us about being in the Gulf War.
His real name is Frank Druce--
and I worked hard to get this one.
He was Special Operations Black Beret
in Mosul, Northern Iraq.
Also, he didn't get sick
from the encounter the other night.
He's been to the V.A. hospital for treatments three times
in the past year.
We had it.
We had it and we let it go.
Four days ago an Iraqi Air Force pilot
shot down an unidentified flying object.
The wreckage and possibly the occupants
were recovered by the army.
Ranheim the truck driver would be a perfect escort
for the wreckage and/or bodies
out of Iraq to a laboratory in the United States.
That would explain why the truck weighs
so much more than listed.
The military has, in the past,
transported dangerous materials and weapons
in unmarked trucks across the country.
I'm beginning to sound like those guys
over at The Lone Gunman, right?
Where did you obtain this information?
Let's just say it's a source with a deep background.
I want to know all about him.
All I know is that he's guided us away from harm.
How do you know that?
We work for the Federal Bureau of Investigation
and we're being bugged.
What does that tell you?
That tells me that not everything is
as it appears to be.
Exactly, and for all we know,
this deep background is the one responsible for the bug.
He's never lied to me.
I won't break that confidence.
I trust him.
Mulder, you're the only one I trust.
Then, you're going to have to trust me.
Did you find out where the truck is now?
Generally.
It's heading west, towards Colorado.
Okay, we've got to try to intercept it
and see what's on board.
I'm going to go pick up a few things.
I'll meet you back at your place
in an hour, okay?
I cut the main breaker.
You risked exposure coming here.
What I have here is too important.
The photograph in that envelope
was taken by an officer at Fort Benning, Georgia.
17 UFOs were spotted in one hour.
Is that where the Iraqi wreckage is being held?
Are UFOs monitoring the area?
Nice place you have here.
Wait. Wait.
I-I just wanted
to take this opportunity to thank you.
You've helped my work so much
and you've never asked for anything in return,
and, and I know you've put yourself
at great risk to do so.
This is the best photographic evidence I have ever seen.
When I first saw the Gulf Breeze photos,
I knew they were a hoax,
but this, this is the quality of evidence
the government has amassed for decades
at the highest classified levels.
That business with the truck
was just a decoy to keep anyone looking closely
away from Fort Benning,
where they are keeping the remains of the Iraqi UFO.
We've got to leave for Georgia immediately, Scully, come on.
Mulder, this photograph is a fake.
What?
Look.
This soldier's shadow is allegedly created
by the lights from the UFO,
but it falls in a direction
contradictory to the craft's position.
There could be an off-camera
light source creating that shadow.
Now, look closely at the color of the light
reflected in the windshield.
Now, that reflection should be
from the red lights of the UFO,
but it doesn't match the color of the ship's lights.
There's probably a degree of tint
in the windshield, or the gradation could be attributed
to atmospheric conditions.
Mulder, we should have it analyzed.
Why don't you just admit it, Scully?
You're determined not to believe him.
Well, maybe you're too determined
to believe him.
I am determined to follow a lead
that may result in the proof of the existence
of extraterrestrial biological entities.
I need to go.
Mulder, listen to me. No.
Please, will you just hear me?
I have never met anyone
so passionate and dedicated to a belief as you.
It's so intense that sometimes it's blinding.
But there are others
who are watching you, who know what I know,
and whereas I can respect and admire your passion,
they will use it against you.
Mulder, the truth is out there, but so are lies.
Thank you.
I had the photo analyzed by the Bureau's computers.
Initially it appears to be legitimate.
The film grain matches in pattern and density,
color levels, shading.
Then I noticed this.
It's the moon, half full.
I had the reflection in this window
enlarged by 25.
There's the moon again,
a quarter full,
not to mention the fact that the window
couldn't even catch the moon's reflection
from that angle.
You were right, Scully, it's a fake.
He tried to deceive us.
Now we're alone on this.
There's no one we can trust.
They went to a lot of trouble
to put us on the wrong track.
There's something here
that no one's supposed to find.
Why didn't you leave for Fort Benning?
The photograph was a fake.
Well, at least you're not insulting me further
by feigning appalled surprise.
On the contrary, I think a compliment is in order.
That photo was prepared by our very best.
I thought you were my ally. Oh, I am.
Yeah, imagine if Eisenhower told the rest of the Allies
that D-day would take place in Belgium.
Mr. Mulder, I place my life
in great jeopardy every time we speak.
I've been a participant in some of the most insidious lies
and witness to deeds that no crazed man could imagine.
I spent years watching you
from my, uh, lofty position
to know that you were the one I could trust.
Then, why did you lie to me?
I needed to divert you.
You and Scully are excellent investigators,
and your motives are just.
However, there still exist some secrets
which should remain secret-- truths that people
are just not ready to know.
Who are you to decide that for me?
The world's reaction to such knowledge
would be far too dangerous.
Dangerous. You mean in the sense of outrage,
like the reaction to the Kennedy assassination or M.I.A.s
or radiation experiments on terminal patients, Watergate,
Iran-Contra, Roswell, the Tuskegee experiments.
Where will it end?
Oh, I guess it won't end as long as...
men like you decide what is truth.
That transcript you gave me of the Iraqi pilot--
that was the truth, wasn't it?
Yeah.
Why did you even bother to show it to me?
Well, I was aware that you were onto the truck,
so I knew that, down the road, I would have to steer you away,
that I would have to lie to you, and a lie, Mr. Mulder,
is most convincingly hidden between two truths.
Mulder.
If a shark stops swimming, it will die.
Don't stop swimming.
I'm not responsible for the electronic surveillance,
but I do know they can still hear you.
Mulder.
Are you home?
I've been thinking about this whole situation, you know,
and I think you're right.
I think they won this one, I think we should just move on.
I think this time you're right, Mulder.
All right, stick with him.
Hey!
There you are, Ms. Scully,
your round-trip ticket to Chicago.
Here's your credit card.
And the plane departs at Gate 35.
I'd also like a one-way ticket to Los Angeles
with a stop in Las Vegas, and for that I'll be paying cash.
Called every weigh station and bureau office west of Colorado.
Tied up an airphone for three hours.
I don't speak Japanese, but I think some businessman
told me to stick a piece of sushi where the sun don't shine.
My ear's numb from being on hold for so many hours.
At least we can be sure they didn't trace our call.
I couldn't find the truck.
Did you have any luck?
Yep, it's heading northwest on I-90.
We have to get a couple tickets to Seattle.
Yeah, think about it.
This truck drove across America.
People it passed on the road probably thought
it was hauling auto parts or furniture,
you know, livestock, whatever.
Nobody would have suspected
it was hauling a craft from another world.
Here we go.
Mulder, we've been following this truck for hours.
Maybe he knows we're following him
and he's taking an evasive route.
Well, if that were the case...
You all right?
Yeah.
Come on.
Ranheim!
Ranheim?
Scully.
Oh, my God.
It was an extraterrestrial biological entity... alive.
Where did it go?
I think we were just witness to a rescue mission.
God, Mulder, I can't stop shaking.
What just happened-- does it fit the profile?
Are you asking if it was real?
Did we just have a close encounter?
No, it was another hoax.
But how could anyone generate such force?
Whatever they used, we probably haven't heard of it.
Sound weapons, stealth helicopters
with an ultrahigh- intensity light.
It doesn't matter.
There's no evidence that this was a UFO.
So they created this elaborate show
just to deflect us again?
I mean, wouldn't it have been easier for them just...
Just to kill us.
Yeah, I've wondered that myself.
Maybe they're using me against myself
like you said before.
That I want so badly to believe, that I'd just accept
the obvious conclusions and walk away.
Well, now we have nothing to go on.
No one to turn to.
There's still one player in all this who hasn't lied to us,
but it's not quite someone we can turn to.
Levering and Priest Rapids,
east bank of the Columbia River.
Did you send out a field investigator?
And you can substantiate the sighting?
Okay, Nick, thanks a lot.
I've contacted several organizations
that have hotlines for UFO reports--
Center for UFO Studies in Chicago,
MUFON, NICAP--
none of them have ever reported a week of such activity.
It began in Tennessee
where Ranheim was encountered.
The sightings are following
the path of the truck.
And after last night's hoax...
look at this.
Seven sightings in Mattawa,
Washington-- that's 100 miles away.
Aliens?
Looks like they want their colleague back.
We've driven full circle through Mattawa twice.
There's nothing here.
What's over there?
We have been waiting.
Welcome to our home.
We are willing to go with you.
Ahh-doo-nay-vah-so-barahgahs.
That's an intergalactic space greeting.
It means "Hello, space brothers."
Hello.
What's going on here?
A UFO party.
You've seen UFOs?
Last two nights. They're drawn to our electric power.
They hover over the power plant down there.
Everyone, they are here.
This is it.
There's Ranheim.
This place has got to have the highest level of security.
It's just the kind of challenge they're looking for.
Who?
Lone Gunman.
It's Mulder. Turn the tape recorder off.
Okay, it's off.
Turn it off! It's off already.
How would you like to have on your front page
the first substantiated photo
of an extraterrestrial biological entity?
No way. An E.B.E.?
What do we have to do?
Just hack me some identification numbers.
Braidwood and Stefoff.
Personal identification number?
7-5-9-3.
5-3-1-1.
Open the trunk, please.
Park in lot four.
Thanks.
Hey, wait!
Display these at all times.
Proceed.
Langly said he couldn't gain access to Level 6,
so that's where we...
We have to go back, we have to get through that door.
We're going to look suspicious going back.
We have to find other access, then, come on.
Mulder, they're not going to let us.
You folks come with me, please.
Yeah, we're lost, we're just looking for-- we're trying to...
Just proceed down the hallway.
Yeah, if you could just help us...
Mulder, stop.
We're agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
I'm reaching for my I.D.
We're here conducting
an investigation.
Proceed down the hallway, please.
This is Level 2 to Level 6.
I have a male and a female who have identified themselves...
Mulder! Stop!
Hold it!
He's in the stairs! Go, go, go!
Come on, guys.
Stay on top of him.
Halt!
I said hold it!
Halt!
Let him go.
Let him go.
You've done well.
You're dismissed.
I know how badly,
how... very badly you want to look through that window,
but it would be pointless.
It's dead.
After the Roswell incident in 1947,
even at the brink of the Cold War,
there was an ultrasecret conference
attended by the United States,
the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, Britain,
both Germanies, France,
and it was agreed that, should
any extraterrestrial biological entity survive a crash,
the country that held that being would be responsible
for its extermination.
I, um... have the distinction of being one of three men
to have exterminated such a creature.
I was with the CIA in Vietnam.
A UFO was sighted for five nights over Hanoi.
The marines shot it down and brought it to us.
Maybe... it didn't know what a gun was
or perhaps they don't show emotion...
but that... innocent and blank expression
as I pulled the trigger has haunted me...
until I found you.
That's why I come to you, Mr. Mulder,
and will continue to come to you to atone for what I've done,
and maybe sometime,
through you, the truth will be known.
You're awfully quiet, Mr. Mulder.
I'm wondering which lie to believe.
- Hello?
Hello!
Hey, I'm sittin' here, dude!
Sorry. We're closed.
Uh-uh. I was here before you turned off the light.
Grandfather clause, man.
I need a Super Patty Double with cheese...
The light was a mistake.
We're closed. Sorry.
The light was on!
How bad do you want this job? 'Cause I'll call the head office right now!
- Super Patty Double...
with cheese, super size fries, super size Diet Sprite.
Drive through, please.
What the hell is this?
Customer service, man! Stop spankin' it and get my food!
Hey in there.
Guy?
You are your own man,
and you control everything you do.
- How ya doin'? - Hey, Rob.
- Hey, Mr. Rice. - How's it going, Rob?
- Have a good one, Lucy. - You too, Rob.
Welcome to Lucky Boy. May I take your order?
Sir, would you do us a favor and gather your employees, please?
- What's going on? - We're investigating a murder.
It's a badge that's only given to employees. Is that correct?
Yeah. "Free Fer Fridays." It's our promotion...
where you buy one Super Patty and get one free.
But look, there's four Lucky Boys in Costa Mesa alone,
and something like 30 in Orange County.
- Does everybody have their button? - We only wear them on Fridays.
"Free Fer Fridays."
Yeah, but does everybody have their button?
Hey, uh, you back there. What's your name?
Derwood Spinks.
Derwood. Do you have your button, Derwood?
Uh, no, I must have left it at home,
on account of we're supposed to only wear 'em on Fridays.
Well, I sure as hell didn't leave it on no dead guy.
I don't believe that we said the victim was male.
We're gonna ask everybody to step outside right now...
His name was Donald Edward Pankow.
Does that ring a bell?
No.
I'm gonna get some cigarettes.
I guess I'd better call the corporate headquarters...
and find out what they want us to do.
Hey, Scully.
Check it out. You know how they say...
you never wanna see the kitchen of any of your favorite restaurants?
Somehow, I don't think Lucky Boy would make that list.
My point being that this is a hell of a lot cleaner than all the others.
- Don't you think? - I guess.
to cover up evidence? -  Maybe.
Maybe I'm thinking this was the crime scene.
You're saying Mr. Pankow had his brain...
very neatly removed from his skull right here in this kitchen?
It had to happen somewhere.
But next to the shake machine, Mulder?
I think that we should be checking out employee lockers,
and not entertaining the idea that ad hoc surgery was performed here.
I wouldn't exactly call it "surgery."
What if this man's brain was eaten? It's not sociologically unheard of.
There are certain tribes in New Guinea that consider human brains a delicacy.
It's just that...
nothing about the way the body was dumped suggests a fetishistic killing.
The brain wasn't removed intact.
What if this man's brain was eaten right out of his skull?
Through an inch and a half opening that looks like it was cut with a hole saw?
Well, maybe it was cut. Maybe it was punched.
Like it was made by a...
a tongue, or a proboscis.
The proboscis of what?
I don't know.
Oh. Hello. Look at this.
Does that look like blood to you?
-  Yes, it looks like it. -  What is that?
Next to it. Is that, uh...
Oh, my... Uh. Is that brain... Is that brain matter there?
No, I'd say that's ground beef.
-  Ground beef? - Yeah.
Rob Roberts? It's Agent Mulder.
Hello, again. I'm sorry to bother you at home.
- No. No bother. - Can I come in?
- Yeah, s-sure. Sure. - Great. Great.
Uh, what... what can I do for you?
- You live here alone? - Yeah, it's just me.
- Mom or girlfriend? - What?
Come on, man. Who cleans up after you?
Neither. It's just me. I-I live here alone.
Well, bravo. You know, they say single guys are just bears who own furniture.
I mean, my place, it's...
But here, you can smell the Pine Sol.
Yeah, a cheeseburger and a large order of fries.
It's a bad joke. I'm sorry.
Um, Mr. Rice, your manager,
he told me that, uh, you stayed late on Friday.
- Is that right? - Uh, yeah, sure. Friday.
The freezer had died on us.
I stayed after to throw out the meat that was goin' bad.
- Yeah, did you volunteer to close? - Yeah.
Yeah, okay. You volunteered.
Volunteered.
Um...
The, uh... The 35 pounds of ground chuck...
that Mr. Rice told you to throw away... what did you do with that?
- I threw it out. - Where?
In the Dumpster... behind the restaurant.
Hmm. That's weird.
That's what I figured you did, so I checked the Dumpster, and it was empty.
Which is weird because it only gets cleaned out on Thursday,
and you would've thrown away the meat on Friday.
So you'd expect the meat to be there, right?
I don't see how that's relevant to this murder case anyway.
Let me see if there's anything else I wanted to ask you.
Blood.
You're-You're bleeding.
I-I bit my lip.
Hmm.
I think that just about wraps it up for me here, actually.
Oh, hey, I, uh... I hope you catch the guy, huh?
No, I already got a pretty good idea who it is.
Thanks.
- What do you want? - N-Nothing.
So take a hike.
Uh, hi. This is a message for Rob Roberts.
My name is Dr. Mindy Reinhart,
and I'm a licensed mental health counselor...
with the Lucky Boy Corporation's Employee Assistance Program.
I'm talking to all of the employees at your restaurant...
about the recent unpleasantness that occurred there.
Rob, I'd love for you to come down to my office at 11:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.
As it is a requirement of your employer's insurance provider,
this meeting is mandatory.
I'm in the Irvine Medical Park, suite 308.
- Have a good evening.
Self-discipline. That's the name of this game.
That's the one thing that separates us from the animals,
provided you have it.
So where do you get it? You can't go down...
to the local convenience store and buy self-discipline.
You can't order it over the internet. So where does it come from?
True story. I used to weigh 356 pounds.
Do you believe that? Well, it's true.
I lived to eat, ladies and gentlemen.
My entire life revolved around eating, because I was always hungry.
My appetite was controlling me.
Four-star restaurants, Denny's... It didn't matter, and it didn't stop.
It didn't stop until I took charge of my own life.
It didn't stop until I put on the brakes and I said, "Whoa!"
Ricardo, you are your own man,
and you control everything that you do.
Oh, brother. What?
What... Derwood.
How did you get in here?
It's a little skill I picked up in Chino.
I did a nickel for attempted murder.
You didn't know I was an ex-con?
Yeah, nobody at work did.
Not until this F.B.I. murder investigation...
whipped everybody up into a froth.
Derwood, what can I do for you?
You know I got fired last night?
Stupid little pissant job,
where they make you wear a paper hat.
And they fired me. Plus, as far as that, uh,
redheaded F.B. I agent's concerned,
I'm the prime suspect in this murder.
But that's no skin off my nose, seeing as you did it.
Diet pills.
Yours, right?
See, I found 'em when I opened up on Saturday morning.
I didn't give 'em back because I figured, hey, free speed, right?
But then there's this whole flap about a murder,
and I noticed this.
That ain't ketchup, man.
What-What do you want, Derwood?
I don't know. What do you got?
TV, VCR.
Nah, it's all crappy, off-brand stuff.
But, you know, I'll take that, and whatever money you got in the bank,
and you get this, and I keep my mouth shut.
And just maybe you can blow town...
before the long arm of the law reaches out and grabs you by the gonads.
Maybe not.
Cup 'em.
Uh... Hi.
Uh, Rob?
I hate to bother you, but last night in the front of the building,
there was a man in a parked car for hours.
Did you happen to see him? It was a maroon car.
He was pretty clean-cut, so I didn't call the police.
But he was still there when I went to bed.
Gee, Sylvia, I don't know what to tell you.
- You got it. - Thanks.
- So I'll call you tonight and let you know...
where to drop off my new VCR.
Oh. And don't try skipping town.
You won't get too far.
Hey, just the man I wanted to see.
How are you this morning, Rob?
- Fine. - Yeah. I'm glad I caught you.
Oh, hey, I was just driving to your apartment,
and I saw Derwood Spinks not a block from here.
Good. I'd stay away from him. He's our prime suspect in the Pankow murder.
- You think he did it? - Me? No. No, I should say...
that's the opinion of the Costa Mesa Police, and my partner.
So he's not your guy?
No. No, I think we're looking for somebody who has a compulsion to kill.
Truly can't help himself.
Oh, quick question. The, uh... The meat that you threw in the Dumpster?
- What about it? - The Dumpster had a padlock.
- Yeah. - Who would have the key?
We do,
and the trucking company does.
Hey, wait. What's your point?
I'm just tying up some loose ends.
Good, you got my message, Rob. I appreciate your coming.
This will be really informal. Here you go.
I wanna run through some things with you.
just go ahead and blurt it out, okay?
Hasn't been a run-of-the-mill week so far, has it?
No.
The police have been at the restaurant, and the F.B.I.
I'm sure this has been a very stressful time for you.
Pretty much.
So we wanna keep on top of any potential problems...
that these stresses might cause for you.
- So let's run through some standard questions together.
Rob, have you been troubled recently by insomnia?
- Bad dreams? Nightmares?
Have you felt emotionally numb?
Have you felt emotionally numb?
Do you ever see things that aren't there, or hear voices?
- Tell me, Rob, do you feel... - This...
This murder... This murder that happened?
Yes?
What kind of a monster would do something like that?
I don't believe in monsters.
But I do believe in people.
And sometimes, they do terrible things...
out of weakness or sickness or fear.
But I do truly believe that deep down inside,
even the worst of us wants to be good.
Rob, is there anything that's troubling you that you'd like to talk about?
I'm sorry. I thought I put that on voice mail.
Mindy Reinhart.
Yes, Agent Mulder. What can I do for you?
No, I'm afraid I can't do that.
I'm sorry, but it would violate patient confidentiality.
I, uh...
Excuse me, Agent... Rob?
Yeah? I have to go to work now.
Would you please call me later so that we can finish our talk?
You shouldn't be here, Derwood. We would've mailed you your last check.
Just give me my money, Rice.
How you doin', killer?
You better have some money for me too, huh?
There. Now please leave.
With pleasure, pal.
Oh, I ought to just make happy hour.
Since this is farewell, when nobody was looking,
I used to dip my boys in the coleslaw.
- Ew! - Ew!
Bon appétit.
If somebody's still in here, you're in a world of hurt!
Rob?
You lookin' for these?
The deal's off, buddy.
You know that guy you iced, Pankow?
I just heard he didn't have a brain in his head.
You're one sick little freak, man.
You got a lot of problems.
If I were the F.B.I.,
I'd want you real bad.
Public enemy number one and all that.
Lots of reward money.
So I'm gonna turn you in myself,
"lucky boy. "
- Rob. - Hi.
You said we should finish talking.
Come in.
- I think I need help. - Tell me why you think that.
I have compulsions to eat.
I-I get hungry. And I try to put it off for as long as I can,
but then finally, I just... I get so hungry that I can't help myself, and...
You binge, then purge?
You eat too much, and then cause yourself to vomit?
No. I just eat.
But this makes you feel bad.
I guess it makes me feel like I'm not a good person.
Rob, there are so many different kinds of eating disorders.
Men and women from every walk of life suffer from them.
But if there's one thing that they all have in common, it's low self-esteem.
And it's a shame because low self-esteem can be like a fun house mirror.
It reflects back a warped and ugly image of ourselves.
What do you think Cindy Crawford would look like in a fun house mirror?
Uh, weird?
How would, say, PeterJennings look in a fun house mirror?
- Ugly. - And how do you look...
in this mirror?
Do you think that looks like a bad person?
An unworthy person? I'll tell you what I see.
I see a nice smile.
I see soulful brown eyes.
I see good.
Now, Rob, I want you to keep looking into this mirror...
until you see the same things that I do.
There's a meeting that I'd like you to attend tonight.
It's every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
Now, you can talk to me anytime you want.
But these people are the best. They can really help you.
- I have to go. - You always hurry away.
I appreciate it,
and I want you to understand...
that I really am trying to do right.
He's upstairs. I told him all about that strange man in the maroon car,
and he said he'd look into it.
Afternoon, Rob.
Sir, may we speak with you?
Derwood Spinks has disappeared.
His car is gone, along with some personal belongings.
My partner saw Spinks in your neighborhood yesterday morning.
At that time, you told Agent Mulder that you hadn't seen Mr. Spinks.
Is that correct?
I don't even know him that well.
If he was going to leave town, he wouldn't come tell me about it.
Who said he left town?
I don't know. Isn't that what you think happened?
No, no. Uh, personally, I think he's dead.
I can't speak for my partner, but I think that whatever it was...
that killed Donald Pankow also got to Mr. Derwood Spinks.
What do... What do you mean, whatever it was?
Well, I'll let you in on a little secret.
We've been able to keep it pretty quiet up until now,
but Donald Pankow's brain was missing from his skull.
My partner was able to find something that was previously undetected.
It was the tip of what could only be described...
as a tiny shark's tooth embedded deep in the bone.
I think we're looking for some kind of genetic freak...
a carnivorous predator as yet unidentified.
A monster, if you will.
There's no such thing.
Well, don't you believe it. This thing definitely qualifies.
It has a biological imperative to eat.
I think it even ate that ground chuck you threw away.
Yeah? Why?
Because it can't kill with impunity, and it knows it.
But the hunger is always there,
and it satisfies it anyway it can.
I'm-I'm sorry,
but this is like good cop, insane cop.
Why are you telling me all of this?
I think you know why.
Thank you, Mr. Roberts.
We'll contact you if we have any further questions.
Watch out for that monster.
Devil's food, with the white sugar frosting.
And it is, like, "Deliver me from evil. "
Come on in.
Come on. So,
I baked three dozen of these...
for my daughter's school fund-raiser.
And at 3:00 in the morning the night before there they are,
all three dozen of'em,
lined up and calling to me.
- Well, you know, in the past,
Small world, huh?
Is this your first time at a meeting?
- Yeah.
Does anybody else have anything they want to share?
Do you feel up to introducing yourself? Everybody's really nice.
- Anyone? - Don't be scared. It helped me.
Uh, hi.
My name is Robert Roberts.
People... People call me Rob.
Hi, Rob!
I-I have an eating disorder.
I'm definitely a meat eater,
not a vegetarian.
I've always had these cravings... my whole life.
And just-just recently,
the last month or so,
they've just become too powerful to resist.
Tell us about it.
I guess it's the taste I respond to the most.
Salty and... juicy.
Kind of buttery.
- The texture of it inside of your mouth...
You know, your teeth just sink into it...
like this juicy cloud.
And it tastes so good.
You know, you don't even wanna swallow it.
You just wanna work it around your taste buds...
until your eyes roll right back into your head.
Do you remember when I first came here?
Anyway, it's a real problem.
Wait. Your ex-husband did what?
He said I was too fat to ride in his sports car...
that I'd just mess up the springs.
So I sat on the hood and I bounced.
And I didn't stop until the police showed up.
They sided with me.
Hey, thank you, Sylvia.
Good night, Rob.
Good night, Sylvia.
I'll be right there.
What the hell is going on?
Oh, my God! Call the police!
Everything okay?
Mr. Derwood Spinks, alive and well.
You know what, folks? Why don't we go outside and talk about it there.
I'm confused, Rob.
Was he helping you redecorate?
- I lied to you before. - About what?
Derwood was...
was coming from my place the morning you saw him.
He said if I spoke to you, he'd kill me.
What didn't he want you to tell us?
Last Friday night,
he hung out while I was cleaning out the freezer.
He told me to go home, said he'd finish up.
You know, I... I didn't know why the hell he was being so nice to me.
But when I got home,
I realized I had the key to the Dumpster.
And when I drove back,
I saw him cleaning up all this blood.
You must have been very scared.
I was, but you know, I should have told the truth from the start.
Do you recognize this guy?
- No. - Hmm.
He's a private eye. Sylvia Jassie's ex-husband...
hired him to spy on her.
But now this Steve Kiziak is gone missing.
He was last seen parked outside your apartment.
You didn't notice him?
No, I-I didn't... notice anything.
Well, maybe we should check with Sylvia again.
I don't... I don't think she's home.
Ah, well, we'll track her down.
Don't worry, Rob. It won't be long now.
Oh, my God.
Rob? What happened?
It's a long story.
What do... What do you want?
I, uh... I was in the neighborhood, and I thought I'd say hi.
- Hi. - Rob, are you all right?
Did you do this?
No! Derwood Spinks did this.
You know, he's the one who...
Like I said, it's a long story.
Where are you going?
To a friend's house.
I have to leave, actually, as in now.
Are you sure you're all right? You're not feeling...
Yes, absolutely. I'm-I'm fine, you know?
It's just that when you came to see me yesterday,
I sensed that there were things that you wanted to talk about, but couldn't.
That was yesterday.
Well, can we talk about them now?
Look, let me stop you right there, okay?
You don't have to worry about me anymore.
As of... As of 10:38 a.m.,
I am no longer employed by the Lucky Boy Corporation.
- I quit. - Rob.
I'm here as a friend.
Well, then, consider me cured.
I had a breakthrough last night.
- Did you attend the O.A. meeting? - Yeah.
I'm sorry you felt that way.
So they're a bunch of fat people.
So what? M-M-Maybe they, got, uh,
what you would call a biological imperative...
to eat too much.
Did you ever think of that? Did you?
You know, maybe I've got a biological imperative too.
So why is that such a bad thing?
Like, the world's gonna end? That is biology.
You can't fight biology. You can't.
And I am sick and tired...
of pretending that I'm something that I'm not.
You killed that man, didn't you?
What did you just say?
That's why you feel so guilty, isn't it?
Can you tell me why you did it?
- Who have you been talking to? - No one.
I realized it after our last session.
- You spoke to the F.B.I., didn't you? - I haven't spoken to anyone.
And I won't without your permission, but I am here...
- To ask you to turn yourself in.
I want you to get the help that you need.
- You don't know what the hell you're talking about.
Yes, I do, Rob.
No, you don't!
You said...
you don't believe in monsters.
Right?
How about...
now?
How about...
now?
Do you believe... in monsters?
You poor man.
What you must go through.
- Oh, my God. - Step away, Rob.
- Step away. - Dr. Reinhart, step away from him.
You just can't stop yourself, can you?
Get on the floor.
Rob, get on the floor!
Rob.
Be that good person I know you mean to be.
Why?
I can't be something I'm not.

Unit Four, I got a fire out on the highway at the 20-mile mark.
Unit Four, confirmation of downed aircraft burning.
All units, we've got a 10-13.
Unit Four, this is Detective Miles.
I'm coming right at you, Ray.
Now, you wait for backup before you head out, all right?
Unit Four, come back, Deputy.
Deputy Hoese.
- Ray?
Oh, my God.
Lariat car rentals totals...
Would you like to see the figure?
- Is that a lot? - A lot?
Gas, expenses, the motel rooms alone...
By F.B.I. standards, these numbers are out of control.
We could start sharing rooms.
You're under evaluation. There has to be a point when we say no.
You can't really compare what we do to other departments in the bureau.
- Right. This business with aliens. - There's more to it than that.
But at the end of the day, you'd say aliens are your real focus?
That's the reason I got started, yeah.
Investigating your sister's abduction...
and the government conspiracy around it.
Both of which have been resolved, correct?
Nothing has been resolved, exactly.
In this case report here, it's concluded your sister is dead,
as well as the men who took her.
This is your handwriting here on the report, Agent Mulder?
Yeah.
So, what exactly is left to investigate?
Your release has been arranged.
Marita Covarrubias.
Last time I saw you, I left you for dead.
Alex, if it was strictly up to me,
I'd leave you here to rot too.
I see the money bleed out,
but it just doesn't seem to make the results of your work any better.
So many of the cases you investigate are left unexplained.
Makes it hard to justify the expense.
So much of the work that we do cannot be measured in standard terms.
- How would you measure it? - We open doors...
with the X-Files which lead to other doors.
Doors leading to...
a conspiracy of men who cooperated with alien beings...
"to create human/alien hybrids...
so we could all become slaves of an alien invasion."
I believe that there was once a conspiracy.
I believe I was taken by men...
who subjected me to medical tests...
which gave me cancer and left me barren.
But you don't believe in aliens?
I've seen things that I cannot deny.
Who sent you?
- The Smoking Man.
He's dying.
You said you were finished.
I turned in my report and was asked to go over a few things.
As you know, the times we live in, the world is changing fast.
I'm missing your point.
As I said, this is an evaluation, Agent Mulder, to understand what you do,
so if you go forward, you can do so more responsibly.
That sounds more like a threat.
Cost benefit analysis.
But if you want the truth, I really don't care one way or the other.
You mostly record bizarre facts on bizarre cases.
In other words, information gathering.
Something, it seems to me, you can easily do on the Internet.
I can't do my job from an office. I promise you.
Nowadays, the most advanced space exploration...
is done sitting in an office, Agent Mulder.
Why? It's just too damn expensive putting men in outer space.
- I'm not looking in outer space. - Bringing us to the point.
If you spend so much time and money looking for aliens,
responsibly you should narrow your search.
- To where? - Wherever they are.
It's not unreasonable.
It's just a matter of reducing your vision.
Hey, you all right?
What's the problem?
- Isn't that your car, Mr. Miles? - Yeah.
A small accident.
Everything's all right. What are you boys doing out here?
Well, we heard there was a plane crash.
Military jet fighter collided midair with a U.F.O.
Navy found their plane about three miles away.
We've seen no evidence of any other crash.
But we heard a sheriff say he saw a fire burning...
off the highway at the 20-mile mark.
There's nothing out here. No fire. No sign of fire.
Now, you boys go on home.
There's nothing to see here.
I think I'm in big trouble.
How many times have they tried to shut us down?
Yeah, but I never actually assaulted an auditor before.
- Did you hurt him? - I reduced his vision a little bit.
- Mulder.
-  Agent Fox Mulder? - Speaking.
My name is Billy Miles. I don't know if you remember me.
Yeah, Oregon, seven years ago.
You had multiple abduction experiences. I'm here with Agent Scully.
- Billy, are you all right? - Yeah.
This may seem weird, me calling like this,
but, uh, I don't know where else to turn.
- Is it happening again, Billy?
Yeah, but not to me this time.
More alien abductions, Scully.
Mmm.
I don't know how we could possibly justify the expense.
We'd probably turn up nothing.
Let's go waste some money.
Hi. He's anxious to see you.
- I was worried about you, Alex. - Cut the crap, old man.
I heard about your incarceration.
You had me thrown in that hellhole.
For trying to sell something that was mine, was it not?
I hope we can all move forward,
put the past behind us.
We have a singular opportunity now.
- "Singular opportunity"? - There's been a crash in Oregon.
An alien ship has collided with a military aircraft.
Recovery is all important.
It's Roswell and Corona all over again...
50 years later.
It's our chance to rebuild the project.
How do you know someone hasn't already recovered it?
It's never quite so easy.
- I'm getting something here, Gary. - I told you, Richie.
Hey, man, look at this.
Gary!
Gary?
Come on, man.
My dad got them to fudge the psych qualifications.
- You're married, Billy. - Uh, divorced.
I live back with my dad now.
You've never, um...
Have you ever been able to get over the abductions?
Well, I have, but people haven't. No one really believes it.
My dad still denies it ever happened... that any one of us was taken.
Does he deny that it's happening now?
There was a crash.
A navy pilot hit an unidentified aircraft outside of town.
Now, the military found their jet,
but the other craft hasn't been recovered.
- Why not? - Well, it's our county,
and we're in charge of coordinating efforts.
But my dad has really been no help, even though we have a deputy missing.
You find the U.F.O., and he won't be able to deny the truth.
I hope that's all it is.
What's going on, Bill?
Just talking to some people you might remember, Dad, from the F.B.I.
- Agent Scully, Agent Mulder. - Oh.
What brings you folks out here?
You're not thinking this incident's some kind of U.F.O.?
The crash of an unidentified craft.
Well, I've been on with the F.A.A. You might want to follow up.
Looks an awful lot like there was no crash at all.
Deja vu all over again.
That was there already, in case you're wondering at all about it.
I watched Agent Mulder paint that there seven years ago.
the kind where time gets bent or goes missing...
or where your car loses power and dies in the middle of the road.
These skid marks are mine.
That was the deputy's car up there sitting there without his lights on?
If they'd been on, I would have seen him.
Good point.
Detective?
Did the, uh, deputy carry a.38?
.38 super. Why?
Three shells were discharged.
I imagine they could've rolled from up there.
- What was he shooting at? - Probably nothing.
Was the missing deputy a good cop?
Yeah, sure, I guess.
Married? Single?
Bill!
- Come on over here with those. - He was married. New baby.
You know, they only want to solve this.
Get in the car, Bill.
- Yes? - Sorry to bother you, Mrs. Hoese.
- We're with the F.B.I. - Is this about my husband?
Are... You're Teresa? Teresa Nemman?
Yes.
Seven years ago you came to Agent Scully and I for help.
- You were afraid of being abducted. - Oh, my God.
- Uh...
Please come in.
I'm sorry.
I sort of lost it when I realized who you were.
We, uh, came to see if there's anything that you can tell us...
that might help us find your husband.
We had no idea you were his wife.
I don't know if it's important.
Maybe I just hope it's not, but...
Ray and I have a connection...
that's even deeper for us.
He's an abductee too?
He kept it a secret from almost everyone.
It doesn't make you real popular around here.
His experiences were a lot more terrifying than mine.
He was taken many times and tested.
I have extensive medical records on him...
and photos of his scars.
- I'll get you the files. Can you hold him?
It's okay. Thank you.
What do you see? What do you see?
What's that?
- Once upon a time there was a little baby
- Who is it?
It's me.
- What's wrong, Scully? You look sick. - I don't know what's wrong.
Come in.
I, um...
I was starting to get ready for bed, and I started to feel really dizzy.
Vertigo or something. And then I just... I started to get chills.
You want me to call a doctor?
No, I just...
I just want to get warm.
Oh, good.
Thank you.
It's not worth it, Scully.
What?
- I want you to go home. - Mulder, I'm gonna be fine.
No, no, I've been thinking about it.
Looking at you today holding that baby and...
knowing everything's that been taken away from you...
a chance for motherhood and your health...
and that made me...
think that... maybe they're right.
Who's right?
The F.B.I.
Maybe what they say is true, but for all the wrong reasons.
It's the personal costs that are too high.
There's so much more you need to do with your life.
There's so much more than this.
There has to be an end, Scully.
Of course they can't.
You know why? 'Cause it's not here.
It's there, Alex.
I'm certain of it.
Hidden in plain sight.
You listen to me.
If you're gonna play games, Mulder and Scully, they're gonna beat me to it.
Are you saying that Mulder and Scully are there looking for the U.F.O.?
They're looking for a missing deputy.
Well, they're looking for the right thing, but in the wrong place.
You sent me looking for a ship.
Find the deputy, find the ship.
Who is it?
Ray?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
I was so worried.
I-I was so sure...
What did they do to you this time?
Ray, talk to me.
You're not my husband.
No! No!
What happened, Billy?
Teresa's gone. She's been taken. They took her.
How do you know?
The door was open.
Scully.
The floor.
What do you see?
The same thing as out on the road. We've seen it before.
Yeah.
I have. We both have.
What is it?
It's a biological toxin...
emitted as a gas through the bloodstream.
- From who? - From what is arguably...
an alien.
Oh.
- You okay? - Yeah.
You sure?
Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks.
Thank you, Greta.
Why the trouble to bring Krycek here and then toy with him?
Do you trust Alex, Marita?
- Then why bring him here at all? - You misunderstand.
I've great faith that Alex will find the ship.
But if I told him how,
he'd be tempted to sell the information.
- And you're certain it's there? - Oh, yes.
But it won't be there forever.
It's rebuilding itself.
If he finds the ship, then what?
To possess it...
is to possess the answer to all things.
Every possible imaginable question.
To God?
There's no God, Marita.
What we call God is only alien...
an intelligence much greater than us.
They're coming here, aren't they?
They're only coming back.
Mulder?
Hey!
- You know this guy? - Yeah.
- What are you doing, Richie? - They took him.
They took Gary. He-He was just gone.
- Relax. Slow down. - They're out there!
- I don't care what your dad says, Billy. - My dad?
He was out there too. He knows.
I was shining my flashlight in the dark, looking for the U.F.O.,
and, uh,
the beam hit this spot in space,
like it bent the light.
- And then what happened? - Well, I yelled, "Gary!"
- And then what happened? - Well, I yelled, "Gary!"
And I looked, but he wasn't there. He wasn't anywhere, man.
And then the flashlight got really hot, and I dropped it.
Uh, it was right around here somewhere.
Oh, hey, here it is.
Scully?
Scully?
- Scully.
- You want some water? - What happened to her?
- Can you just get her some water?
I just... I just...
I just hit the ground.
Here, lie still.
Why is this happening to me?
It's okay. It's okay.
- What the hell's going on, Mulder? - I don't know.
But these aren't just random abductions, Scully.
- We've gotta warn Billy Miles of that. - Of... Of what?
These abductees aren't just systematically being taken.
They're not coming back.
Dad?
Billy?
- What are you doing? - You stay where you are.
- Billy, it's me. - I said, stay where you are!
- Damn it, Billy, listen to me. - No.
I don't know who you are, but you are not gonna take me.
I'm your father.
Are you gonna shoot your father?
If you're my father,
then why won't you believe me?
I believe you, Billy. I...
I just want it all to go away.
Give me the gun, son.
Billy?
Billy!
- Agent Mulder? - What's our punishment this time?
Thumb screws or 40 lashes?
Come on in, Walter. Sit a spell.
This could be the last time you take a trip down to these offices.
You went to Oregon.
Guilty as charged.
And if they're coming down on you for that, I'm sorry. I truly am.
Fortunately, they think that I make a contribution to the bureau.
Oh, well, yeah.
Stick to a budget, and they say you're making a contribution.
But push the limits of your profession, and they say you're out of control.
What it comes down to, Agent Mulder, is... they don't like ya.
Well, we didn't bring home a flying saucer or an alien.
Yeah. So I've been told.
Agent Mulder! I think you should listen to him.
You've got every reason to wanna see me dead,
but you gotta listen to me now.
You're the singular opportunity.
- Here, or do you want to step outside? - Agent Mulder.
Cancer Man is dying.
His last wish is to rebuild his project,
to have us revive the conspiracy.
It all begins in Oregon.
The ship that collided with that navy plane... it's in those woods.
- There's no ship in those woods. - Yeah, it's there,
cloaked in an energy field while he mops up the evidence.
- Who? - The alien bounty hunter.
Billy Miles, Teresa Hoese, her husband.
He's eliminating proof of all the tests.
See, we're asking ourselves... We're asking ourselves, "Where are they?"
They're right there. They're right under our noses.
But I'm giving you the chance to change that...
to hold the proof.
Why me? And why now?
I wanna damn the soul of that cigarette-smoking son of a bitch.
Mulder?
What's amazing is that even the military satellites don't see this.
ButJ.P.L. 's TOPEX/Poseidon shows it only as waveform data.
And here it appears simply as a microburst of transmission error...
on the European Space Agency's ERS-2.
If you didn't know what you were looking at or looking for.
- No wonder we couldn't see them. - It is not gonna be there forever.
As we all stand here talking, it's rebuilding itself.
Mulder, if any of this is true...
If it is or if it isn't, I want you to forget about it.
- Forget about it? - You're not going back out there.
It has to end sometime. That time is now.
You're an abductee.
I'm not gonna risk...
Iosing you.
I won't let you go alone.
This is starting to feel like the snipe hunt I was afraid of.
There's no such thing as a snipe, sir.
My ass is on the line here too, Agent Mulder.
I know that.
This just can't be.
What are you looking at?
Medical records. Billy Miles...
and other known abductees in Bellefleur, Oregon.
Which is exactly what Mulder experienced earlier this year.
It knocked me back because it didn't want me.
Mulder thinks that it's me that's in danger of being taken.
When it's Mulder who's in danger.
Scully?
- Scully! - Are you okay?
How's it supposed to work?
Not exactly sure, sir.
- But, um,
budgetarily, I'd say we're looking pretty good.
Agent Mulder.!
Mulder!
Mulder!
Mulder.
We failed.
Perhaps you never meant to succeed.
Anyway,
the hour is at hand, I presume.
What are you doing?
Sending the devil back to hell.
As you do to Mulder and to me,
you do to all of mankind, Alex.
Agent Scully.
- Hi. - Hi.
How are you feeling?
I'm feeling fine.
They're just running some tests on me.
Uh...
I already heard.
I lost him. I don't know what else I can say. I lost him.
I'll be asked...
what I saw.
And what I saw I can't deny.
I won't.
We will find him.
I have to.
Sir, um,
there's something else I need to tell you.
Something that I need for you to keep to yourself.
I'm having a hard time...
explaining it...
or believing it,
but, um,
I'm pregnant.

-  Give it up, Mulder!
- You've got no chance! - Damn it.
My sniper zombies are everywhere.
I'll offer you a deal.
You give me the Lazarus Bowl, and I'll give you Scully.
Mulder!
How 'bout this deal?
You give me Scully, I don't smash the Lazarus Bowl and shove the pieces...
where the Son of God don't shine, you cigarette-smoking mackerel snapper.
I break the Lazarus Bowl, and all your sniper zombies...
go back to being good little well-behaved corpses.
You don't fool me, Mulder. That bowl is your Holy Grail.
Encoded in its ancient ceramic grooves are the words Jesus spake...
when he raised Lazarus from the dead.
Still capable of raising the dead 2,000 years later.
Proof positive of the paranormal.
You can no sooner destroy that than let the redhead die.
Come on, man. Don't break the bowl.
We don't wanna go back to being dead.
There's no food, no women, no dancing. Save the bowl,
and we'll dump that ciggy-smoking stooge for you.
And you'll be the new king of the dead.
I'd rather serve in heaven than rule in hell.
Is that your flashlight, Mulder, or are you just happy to be lying on top of me?
- My flashlight.
- Oh, that.
For seven long years I've been waiting for just the right moment, Scully.
Oh, you're a sick man, Mulder.
Go on.
I love you, Scully. No ifs, ands or...
"Bs."
There were no casualties, no thefts, no note making any demand.
- Who's taking credit for it? - Nobody.
She: Jodie Foster's foster child on a Payless budget.
He's like a Jehovah's Witness meets Harrison Ford's Witness.
Uh, Christ's Church. Isn't that Cardinal O'Fallon's church?
Yes, O'Fallon's residence is adjacent to the crypt.
- Who's Cardinal O'Fallon? - Cardinal "O'Fallen" perhaps.
Um, he's one of the most powerful men in the Church today.
His name often comes up as a possibility for the first American pope.
- Oh.
- "Myopic."
Yes, it does.
- Are you gonna answer your phone?
- Me? - Yeah.
I didn't wanna be rude.
- Sir, who the hell is this guy? - Hello.
This is Wayne Federman. He's an old buddy of mine from college.
He's a writer out in Hollywood now and he's working on a F.B.I. -based movie.
- He's asked me to give him access. - A screenwriter?
It's actually writer/producer.
That's actually just a hindrance/pain in the neck.
Yo, yo, yo. Agent Mulder, I don't wanna eat your lunch.
I'm just here for some procedural flavor. Just a taste.
I have no idea what you just said.
Well, the Skin man's filled me in on your particular bent.
He said that you come at things maybe a little farkatke, a little Star Trekkie,
which is the exact vibe I'm looking for for this thing I'm doing.
It's a Silence of the Lambs meets Greatest Story Ever Told type thing.
It's... beautiful and I will not be in your way.
I'll be strictly Heisenbergian.
A hologram.
where he will act as an observer on this case.
Agent Scully, I require your services here for the morning.
Sir, have I pissed you off...
in a way that's more than normal?
Hey, whatever.
The Church always has enemies, Agent Mulder.
Just some old bones, artifacts, relics,
documents that we store down there in the cold.
I like to think of it as God's refrigerator.
- That's a great line. - Thank you.
- God's refrigerator. - Wayne, shut up.
No treasures to the outside world.
Things of negligible monetary value,
but great spiritual value to the Church...
ancient devotional texts,
medieval relics.
How 'bout the Shroud ofTurin?
No, I'm afraid not.
But we do have the bathrobe of St. Peter.
- You're kidding? - Yes, I am.
- That's a good line. - Thank you.
Wayne, shut up.
Who comes down to the crypt here?
Only myself.
A half a mile of catacombs here.
I like to walk here during lunch.
That's where the bomb went off.
Well, my instinct, Cardinal,
is to see this desecration of the dead less as a murder attempt...
and more as a terrorist act.
- A message...
- Uh, this isn't me. I think it's you.
Excuse me.
That's, uh... That's not me.
Let me check.
Not me.
We never get reception here.
Would that be St. Jude's cell phone, Cardinal?
No.
That's Micah Hoffman.
Micah Hoffman, Willie Mays and Frank Serpico.
That's my holy trinity, Scully.
Of course I'm too young to remember, but...
He was one of the original Weathermen. He was the first Yippie.
He was a better poet than Ginsberg.
And he was also the starting shortstop for his Columbia baseball team.
- He was never heard from again. - The Stones get blamed for everything.
- I don't get it. - This should be it here.
What did Skinner want you for this morning?
Just paperwork.
Mm-hmm.
- Mulder, we should have a warrant. - It's only the Constitution.
No big deal.
- Wow. - "Dis-Feng-Shui."
Mulder, sorry to denigrate a third of your trinity,
but it looks like Hoffman was killed by one of his own bombs.
Well, from Dharma Bum to Dharma Bomb.
I knew Hoffman was a master potter.
Well, it appears he was a master calligrapher as well.
Look, Mulder, we've got gum arabic and sodium hydroxide here.
Whew! These would be used to, uh...
to age the ink and the paper prematurely.
It's a forger's trick.
Well, from counterculture to counterfeiter.
All right, one more pun and I pull out my gun.
Scully, look at that. "Cristos. "
Looks like a religious text. Can you read Greek at all?
Well, it's pretty rusty.
But it looks like some kind of lost gospel.
A gospel of Mary Magdalene.
And "An Account of Christ's Life on Earth After the Resurrection."
- After? - Yeah.
It's a heretical text, Mulder.
Mythical I should say, but long rumored to be in existence.
What would Micah Hoffman be doing with heretical religious texts?
I think the question is, what would Hoffman be doing forging them?
Ay-yi-yi. I think the real question, Agents,
is what might O'Fallon be doing with Hoffman's forgeries?
You don't need a Weatherman to know which way the wind blows.
Don't shoot!
I like the way you guys work... no warrants, no permission, no research.
You're like studio executives with guns.
Should I call you Agent Mulder or Mr. Mulder...
Like Skin man?
Just ignore me.
What's that?
Looks like the same Gospel of Mary Scully I.D. 'd over at Hoffman's place.
So, is this a forgery or is this the real thing?
Well, there is no real Gospel of Mary, Federman.
The original would be a fake.
All right. So is this a real fake or a fake fake?
It's me.
Yes? Nothing new. No, I can hear you.
It's just your voice is...
There's like a crackly sound and then I hear the syllables.
Just talk. You're breaking up.
No. Let me call you back. Okay.
Yeah, I'm telling you. I'm going through a crypt.
Wow.
Oh, my God.
Now, Wayne, I'm sure that it was dark in there...
and that your eyes were playing tricks on you.
And you've been influenced by ghost stories and horror movies...
that take place in crypts and graveyards.
And you hallucinated this vision of these dancing bones...
trying to reconstruct this bowl.
No, I didn't hallucinate.
That was mechanical or C.G.I.
Federman, that wasn't a movie. That was real life.
The difference being?
Well, I have got my flavor here.
Well, you know, sometimes truth can be stranger than fiction.
Well, fiction is quicker than truth and cheaper.
You want my advice? You're both crazy.
Why do you say that?
Well, you're crazy for believing what you believe and...
you're crazy for not believing what he believes.
I'll leave you with that. Thank you.
I miss him already.
You know, Mulder, I know that Federman's B.S. ing you.
So I'm really hesitant to mention this.
But, um, his story reminds me of the Lazarus Bowl.
The Lazarus Bowl?
We had this wacky nun in Catholic school... Sister Callahan.
Twisted Sister. That's my kind of nun, you know.
Well, she would hold up an old piece of wood with a rusty nail in it.
Or she'd show us a vial of red liquid...
and say that it was John the Baptist's blood or something.
She'd be in prison today. You realize that?
Well, she would tell this story of when Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead.
And that Christ's words, the actual incantation to raise the dead,
were recorded in the clay grooves of the pottery...
just like the way music is recorded into vinyl.
Well, Sr. Spooky...
says that these words in the clay...
still have the power to raise the dead just likeJesus raised Lazarus.
That is a very cool story coming from you, Scully.
I'll have Chuck Burks meet you over at my office.
See if this clay has Christ's greatest hits on it.
And I'm gonna... I'm gonna go have another audience with Cardinal O'Fallon.
There's music in the air, Agent Scully.
See, everything that exists vibrates, and therefore sings...
the street, your internal organs,
electricity, everything.
Here, I'll show you. You see?
This is my voice bouncing around in the red here.
And all this yellow is ambient sound that we habitually tune out.
It's the hum of my hardware,
Mulder's porn tapes on pause, sounds from the street.
Everything we hear but we don't know we hear...
I can hear it with this machine.
Oh.
What is it?
Who made this?
We're not sure.
Either a forger by the name of Micah Hoffman...
or, uh, someone else in the vicinity ofJesus Christ.
"Buzzinga."
Whoever did it is some kind of a musical genius.
This clay is vibrating in all the keys at once. It's heavenly.
Can you translate what it says there for me, please?
Did you recover them from the crypt?
Yes.
"And then Jesus took his beloved Mary Magdalene in an embrace.
"An embrace not of God and woman, but of man and woman.
"And Jesus said to Mary, 'Love the body...
"'for it is all of the soul...
that our senses can perceive."'
And how about these?
These appear to be copies of the original.
- Rough drafts. - How?
They're all forgeries, sir.
Did you buy these from Micah Hoffman?
I thought they were real.
Yeah, I can understand that. Hoffman was a master.
The paper is authentic, the ink, the hand, the diction, everything.
Hoffman was also an explosives expert.
Do you have any idea what he might have been doing with a bomb in the crypt?
Can you think of anybody who might have wanted to kill Micah Hoffman?
No.
Why were you hiding the documents, sir?
When Micah came to me... with these,
as I then thought ancient texts,
and our experts verified them,
it exploded a bomb in my heart.
The Christ that I loved was not the Christ in these texts.
So you bought them in order to hide them.
To keep others from feeling the despair...
and the anger that I felt.
To protect people from what I can now see they needed no protection from.
Why didn't you just destroy the documents yourself?
I thought they were real.
I hated them. I despised them.
I would have liked to destroy them, but I couldn't.
Is being made a fool of a crime, Agent Mulder?
I'd be doing life if it were, sir.
- Scully.
Hey, Scully, it's me. Can you horn in on the Hoffman autopsy for me?
He was blackmailing O'Fallon with those forgeries. Maybe O'Fallon retaliated.
Mulder, this bowl...
Your buddy Chuck Burks says that it has properties he's never seen before.
- Hold on a second. That's my other line.
- Mulder. -  Agent Mulder?
It's Wayne/Federman out in L.A.
Listen. Who do you see playing you in the movie?
- I'm in the movie? - It's a character loosely based on you.
- It's more of an amalgamation. - Hold on a second, Wayne.
- Sr. Spooky, I gotta take this. - I'll call you after the autopsy.
Thanks.
- How 'bout Richard Gere?
Yeah, okay. Seriously.
What if I said to you the name Garry Shandling?
Wayne, you're breaking up. It sounded like you said Garry Shandling.
Garry Shandling signed on to play the amalgamation loosely based on you.
And Tea Leoni's playing the amalgamation loosely based on your partner.
You stud. The movie's called The Lazarus Bowl.
- How do you know about the Lazarus Bowl? - The Skin man.
Listen, Shandling and Leoni wanna meet you guys.
Get your flavor. It's an actor type thing.
Come on out to the studio on our dime. We'll make it nice.
Hey, who's... Well, then who's gonna play Skinner in the movie?
- Richard Gere.
Fracturing of skull and surface abrasions...
initially consistent with concussive force injuries.
I am, uh, now weighing the heart which is... relatively normal,
although somewhat large.
- I'm gonna need that when you're done with it.
Oh, my God!
Hoo-yeah!
- Who are you? - I am who I am.
Uh-uh.
Ow! Damn it!
What'd you find, Scully?
In Micah Hoffman's stomach there were traces of red wine and strychnine.
Man, oh, Manischewitz. Communion wine I bet.
That's possible, Mulder.
I could get a warrant for O'Fallon.
You are the one God, living and true.
Through all eternity you live an unapproachable life.
Mulder, let's allow the man some dignity, okay?
You fill your creatures with every blessing...
and lead all men to the joyful vision of your life.
In our joy, we sing to your glory with all the choirs of angels.
Holy, holy, holy Lord.
God of power and might.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory.
Hosanna in the highest.
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
Hosanna in the highest.
LordJesus Christ, you said to your apostles,
"I leave you in peace. My peace I give you. "
Let's get this over with.
And grant us the peace and unity of your kingdom. Amen.
Augustine O'Fallon, you're under arrest for the murder of Micah Hoffman.
- You have the right to remain silent. - Oh, my God.
Do you see what I see?
Yes, I do.
-  Is that Micah Hoffman? -  Yes, it is.
Misidentification of a corpse and subsequent unrequested autopsy.
Sir, the dead man looked very much like Micah Hoffman.
He had Hoffman's I.D. on him.
Agent Scully, if I'm carrying Marilyn Monroe's purse,
do you assume that I slept with J.F.K.?
But this is the first time, and I hope you're as proud of this as I am,
A bomb went off. A crime's been committed.
There's a dead body nobody seems to give a damn about.
O'Fallon's been less than forthcoming.
And Hoffman at the very least is guilty of forgery and extortion.
Agent Mulder, you will leave O'Fallon alone.
Best case scenario, you get to keep your jobs.
which will feature you two as the sacrificial lambs!
As of right now,
I think this whole Richard Gere thing is going to Skinner's head.
- We're off this case, Mulder. -  Compadres.
I teased out something very fabulous from your pottery there.
- Layered in under the ambience...
There. Guess what language that is.
- Chuck, I've had a bad day. - It's a dead language.
I had a linguist in here to listen to the recording. It's Aramaic.
That's the language that Christ spoke.
Did your, uh, linguist happen to translate it?
Yes, he did. It's in two parts.
The first part, here, roughly translates as,
"I am the walrus. I am the walrus. Paul is dead. Goo goo g'joob."
Although there is no Aramaic word for walrus.
So it literally says, "I am the bearded cow-like sea beast."
- What is it? - It appears to be one man...
commanding another to rise from the dead.
Lazarus?
I am becomeJesus Christ.
I am become skeptical.
There I was totally bumming after Altamont.
And I thought, throw in the towel and go to law school...
or continue to fight and become a forger of scandalous religious documents.
I suppose that's a choice every young, gifted, American male is faced with.
I knew O'Fallon from college.
- He was a divinity professor of mine. - At Columbia?
Yeah. And he is a decent man, but with an overweening pride...
and sense of responsibility born of a fundamental...
lack of respect for the human animal.
He believes in God, but not in man...
and man's ability to choose to live in freedom.
He has Christ in his brain, but not in his heart.
So, uh,
you created a Christ...
in these forgeries that was more suited to your particular world view?
Yeah, but before I could write like Christ, I had to become him,
in much the same way I imagine an actor who plays a part becomes that part.
So I immersed myself in Jesus Christ.
Not just the Church and teachings,
but the man, the custom of his time,
the language, the vibe, the feeling of Christ.
So why didn't O'Fallon and the elders...
go outside the Church for authentification?
But then...
something truly weird came over me.
Remorse?
Conversion, Agent Scully.
The lightning bolt...
that transformed Saul to Paul on the road to Damascus.
One day, I was not just impersonating Jesus Christ,
I had become him.
That's why I blew up the crypt.
The forgeries were blasphemous and needed to be destroyed.
How did your...
cell phone get on the dead man in the crypt?
God works in mysterious ways.
God works in mysterious ways.
Well, as long as they can think, we'll have our problems.
But those whom they are using cannot think.
They are the dead brought to assimilate life by our electrode attempts.
- It's open!
You know, it's an interesting thing when you consider...
you Earth people who can think...
are so frightened by those who cannot... the dead.
Couldn't sleep either, huh?
- Plan 9 from Outer Space? - Yeah.
It's the Ed Wood investigative method.
This movie is so profoundly bad in such a childlike way...
that it hypnotizes my conscious critical mind...
and frees up my right brain to make socio-poetic leaps.
And I started flashing on Hoffman and O'Fallon.
How there's this archetypal relationship.
Like Hoffman's Jesus to O'Fallon's Judas.
Or Hoffman's Jesus to O'Fallon's Dostoyevsky's grand inquisitor.
Or Hoffman's Jesus to O'Fallon's St. Paul.
How 'bout Hoffman's Roadrunner to O'Fallon's Wile E. Coyote?
- Mulder? - Yeah?
Do you think it's at all possible that Hoffman is reallyJesus Christ?
Are you making fun of me?
No.
Well, no, I don't.
But crazy people can be very persuasive.
Well, yes, I know that.
Maybe true faith is really a form of insanity.
- Are you directing that at me? - No!
I'm directing it at myself and at Ed Wood.
Well, you know, even a broken clock is right 730 times a year.
- How... - Forty-two.
- You've seen this movie 42 times? - Yes.
Doesn't that make you sad?
It makes me sad.
- You ever been to Hollywood? - A couple of times a few years ago.
You're going to be there in the morning.
Just a few minutes from Hollywood in the town of San Fernando.
Reports have come in of saucers flying so low...
You know, Scully, we've got four-weeks probation vacation and nothing to do.
And Wayne Federman's invited us out to L.A. to watch his movie being filmed.
And God knows I could use a little sunshine.
Scully?
California, here we come.
-  Beep, beep.
Agents? So glad you could hang.
Come on. I want you to meet the people that are gonna play you.
- Nice to meet you. Big fan. Fox Mulder. - No kidding?
You know, while I've got you here, maybe, uh...
maybe you could show me how to run in these things.
Right over here I was thinking 'cause, I tell you...
I mean, I'm having a hell of a time with these heels.
- Hey, uh... - Hi.
How are you? Seriously, listen. Can I ask you something?
What... What do you mean?
Look, when I play a character, I need to find his center,
his sort of rudder, so to say.
And then everything comes from that.
Uh...
I guess mostly to the left.
Mostly?
Most of the time.
Most of the time... to the left.
Mm-hmm.
Wardrobe!
-  Rolling!
And "rollando."
Come on, now. Kick it in the ass. And action, zombies!
- What is this?
Cut. Go ahead, ruin my career. - What seems to be the problem?
What the hell is this? What the hell's in my mouth?
What is Tea Leoni's shoulder made out of?
Craft services, what is Tea Leoni's shoulder made of?
- Turkey, just like you asked for. - Turkey.
- Miss Leoni's shoulder's made of turkey. - Tofu turkey!
Tofurkey! I asked for Tofurkey!
I'm a vegetarian! Half the zombies are vegetarians! Oh, my God!
The people are made out of turkey.
-  Hello? - Mulder, it's me. What are you doing?
I'm, uh, working at the computer. What are you doing?
I'm, uh, packing. Just getting ready for our trip back to D.C. tomorrow.
How come when people come back from the dead,
they always wanna hurt the living?
Well, that's because people can't really come back from the dead, Mulder.
Ghosts and zombies are just projections of our own repressed...
cannibalistic and sexual fears and desires.
They are who we fear that we are at heart.
Just mindless automatons who can only kill and eat.
Party pooper. Well, I got a new theory.
I say that when zombies try to eat people, that's just the first stage.
So first they're gonna eat, then they're gonna drink.
Then they're gonna dance and make love.
Oh, I see. So it's just that we never get to stay with them long enough...
to see the gentler side of the undead.
- Exactly.
Hold on a second. That's my other line. Hello?
No, sir. I'm just at the computer.
Oh. I appreciate that, Skin man.
- Don't call me that. - Yes, sir.
- Um, where are you now? - I'm right underneath you.
I'm in L.A. at the same hotel as you, right below you and Agent Scully.
Federman got me an associate producer credit on the movie.
A.P. Skinner, huh?
Uh, so what are you up to right now, sir?
I'm taking a bubble bath.
Uh, hold on just one second, sir.
Hey, Scully, Skin man is calling me from a bubble bath.
It's still me, Mulder.
Uh, sorry. Just-Just hold on one second, sir.
- Scully? - Yeah.
Skinner is calling me from a bubble bath.
Wow. He's really gone Hollywood.
- Totally. - You know, Mulder,
speaking of Hollywood, I think that Tea Leoni has a little crush on you.
Oh, yeah, right. Like Tea Leoni's ever gonna have a crush on me.
I think that Shandling likes you a bit too.
Really?
I love you, Scully.
- No, ifs, ands or... - "Bs."
Wait. Wait, Mulder. I can't.
I know this feels wrong because we're friends...
and we treat each other as equals, but...
No. No, it's not that. It's not that.
Well, what then?
I'm in love with Assistant Director Walter Skinner.
- What does he have that I don't have? - A bigger flashlight.
I've been looking all over for you.
They got it so wrong, Scully.
I got a page from the Washington bureau.
Micah Hoffman was murdered tonight.
Murdered in his own home by Cardinal O'Fallon,
who then hanged himself.
A murder/suicide.
It's Jesus and Judas, Scully.
Well, it's all over now.
No, no.
It's just beginning.
Hoffman and O'Fallon were these complicated,
flawed, beautiful people.
And now they'll just be remembered as jokes because of this movie.
How silly is that?
- Pretty silly. - And what about us?
How are we gonna be remembered now because of this movie?
Well, hopefully the movie will tank.
And it'll all become oversimplified...
and trivialized and Cigarette-Smoking "Pontificized"...
and become as plastic and meaningless...
as this stupid plastic Lazarus Bowl.
I think the dead are beyond caring what people think about them.
Hopefully we can adopt the same attitude.
You do know that there aren't real dead people out there, right?
That this is a movie set?
- The dead are everywhere, Scully.
Well, we're alive.
And we're relatively young.
that he has given us a bureau credit card...
to use for the evening.
Come on.
Mulder, I have something to confess.
Ah, me too.

Bad boys What you want, what you want
What you gonna do
When the SheriffJohn Brown come for you

What you gonna do
Yeah
Bad boys, bad boys What you gonna do

Cops is filmed on location...
with the men and women of law enforcement.
All suspects are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.
Yeah, I don't know what it is about a full moon.
It's just, uh... There's something about it. People just go off the wall.
These are some pretty scary neighborhoods to begin with.
I haven't been on the job that long myself,
but I've seen more than my fair share of crazy stuff.
When the moon is full, it's just like times ten.
I don't know, uh... I don't know.
Maybe it's the tides or something.
But irregardless, we're on the job.
And if that makes people breathe a little easier knowing we're out there...
or being a little less nervous walking the streets at night,
well, that's a good feeling.
Okay.
We got a report of somebody lurking around the neighborhood making noise.
Actually, I take that back. We got a report of a...
a monster lurking around the neighborhood.
What... Hey, it's a full moon.
A lot of drug activity in this district.
We're probably looking at somebody rattlin' doorknobs...
trying to steal some money for a quick fix.
Usually, they're not the stealthiest of criminals,
so maybe we'll get lucky,
sneak up on 'em.
212-Adam is 10-97.
212-Adam is 10-97 at 543 Vogel.
212-Adam to Dispatch. I don't see anything.
Can you let the lady know inside her house... know I'm out here?
212-Adam, copy your request. Calling now.
- Figures, doesn't it? Psst!
A lot of scratches.
Maybe a big dog's probably what she saw.
Sheriff s Department!
Uh...
- Senora?
Man, she's scared of somethin'.
- Hey, you, there!
You, freeze! Sheriff s Department!
Freeze! Sheriff s Department!
Run! Run to the car! Back to the car, now!
Now! Run!
Run, Run!
- Now! Now! Come on! Get up! Go, go, go!
Back to the car! Come on! Run!
Run!
Get in the car! Get in the car!
Holy Come on!
- 10-33! 10-33! Patrol Adam needs assistance!
I need assistance at the 500 block of Vogel! I need assistance!
I need... 9-9-9! 9-9-9!
Everybody all right?
Hey, you all right? You all right?
Keith. What was this?
I was responding to a 9-21 at this house right here, and, uh...
- It was a prowler call. - You flipped it?
No, no. Hell, no, I didn't... I didn't flip it.
It was... We were parked.
The... We were attacked.
- By who? By gangbangers? - Uh...
Okay. Fan out and search.
Hey, you'd better double everybody up.
Okay, hold on a minute. Uh, everybody double up.
Set up a command post and check on that air shift.
How many? Keith? Keith?
Um, you know, I didn't get a good look. Maybe...
4-17 suspects on foot just one block north of Holly.
Armed suspects! Bring some units around side Holly Street!
Get your hands up! Get your hands up!
We're the F.B.I.!
- Turn around! - I've got I.D. in my back pocket!
- We're investigating a case! - Hands behind your head!
- Check the I.D.!
Hands behind your head!
Check my I.D. in the back pocket.
They're both F.B.I. Give 'em back their guns.
- Thank you. -  We're investigating a case.
- What case? - Same case you're working on.
- So who we looking for? - Not "who." What.
- Mulder, what the hell is going on here? - I don't know.
- You okay? You all right? -  See the claw marks here?
- You okay? You all right? -  See the claw marks here?
Someone tried to get in.
Hey, Deputy? Deputy, can you describe for me what you saw?
Um... Well, I mean, it's pretty dark,
and I-I didn't really see.
- I don't know what... I don't know. - You must've seen something...
in order to run away from it.
Huh? You were responding to the same call we were...
of a monster prowling the neighborhood.
We've been to this house before. The lady has a history of medication.
There's been half a dozen such sightings in this area in the past 60 days.
Were you aware of that?
- No. - Yeah.
Also, these sightings only occur on nights when there's a full moon,
- Which tells me something. -  What?
What you saw was large, right? Maybe seven, eight feet tall...
when it stood up on its two legs, and it was covered in fur...
and had glowing red eyes and claws...
claws sharp enough to gouge the wood off that front door.
- You're not serious? - And dare I forget teeth?
It bit you, didn't it? Yeah, look at that.
Deputy, how long were you gonna hide that from the E.M.T. s?
- I don't... - Where'd you get that, Keith?
I don't even know where that came from.
I mean, I didn't see anything that he's talking about.
Big teeth, eight feet tall.
- What the hell are you describing? - A werewolf.
- Excuse me? - It's what did that.
It also attacked one Hymen Escallera 29 days ago during the last full moon.
Hymen died of his wounds in Compton General Hospital,
but not before giving a detailed description of what attacked him.
My partner and I are here to catch it.
Unfortunately, though, Deputy, you've been bitten.
The skin is broken.
Werewolf law pretty much universally holds that...
- So... - Wait a minute. I mean...
But see, that's not really what happened, though.
I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to be isolated and kept under guard.
With all due respect, what the are you talkin'about?
- Can I see your badge again? - Agent Mulder?
Can we have a word a second?
Excuse me. What is it?
What is it? Mulder, have you noticed that we're on television?
I don't think it's live television, Scully. She just said
But it's a camera, and it's recording.
It's recording everything that you are saying. Do you understand that?
I just wanna make sure that you're clear on that.
Sure, I'm clear on that, Scully.
My point being, Mulder, that we are on a case.
Well, this presents an opportunity. I feel we're very close here.
And the possibility of capturing concrete proof of the paranormal...
- What's not to love? - Well...
I may not agree with you, but at least I'm not gonna hold it against you.
But this... Mulder, this could ruin your career.
What career?
Scully, I appreciate it. You don't want me looking foolish.
I do. I appreciate that.
I don't want me looking foolish, Mulder.
Okay, fine. Well, do me a favor.
Will you just escort Deputy Wetzel to the hospital?
Just keep an eye on him in case I'm right? Thank you.
- I'm gonna call Skinner, Mulder. - Okay.
I'm sure he's gonna wanna say a couple words about this.
Guys, give it a rest, huh?
She says, uh... I guess she's calling it a claw monster...
was trying to break into the house and get her.
Uh, it was big and had claws pretty much. Keeps going on and on.
Yeah, all right. Tell her to describe it in detail to the sketch artist.
- Will you work with her? Yeah. - Claw monster?
- Just do it, Ricky. - Okay.
Hey, look at that. Excuse me.
Look at this. It's like five claw marks.
- Agent, you seriously believe... - Huh?
we're lookin' for some kind of a...
I'll show you.
This.
This is what Hymen Escallera described...
just before succumbing to his injuries.
Ten to one, that's what Mrs. Guerrero's gonna describe too.
Sir? Sir? We got your suspect.
Claw monster! Claw monster!
Claw monster. Boy, you know, they kill him in every movie,
and he just keeps coming back.
- Now, this is... this is strange. - Mm-hmm.
Gracias, Mrs. Guerrero. We're lookin' for gangbangers.
Um, you don't think it's some guy dressed up like Freddy Krueger, do you?
Can somebody walk me to my car? It's dark out, and I'm parked up the street.
Yeah, come on, Ricky. I'll walk you to your car.
- Can I return this vest later? - Yeah, you can return the vest later.
You catch?
- Catch-Catch him? - Si. Si.
You catch.
How's Deputy Wetzel?
- You let him get released? - Well,
those weren't teeth marks, Mulder.
They turned out to be insect bites.
Individual welts or stings of some sort.
Together, they just look like a larger pattern,
especially when we want them to.
Although, it was an understandable conclusion...
that I'm sure anybody would have made.
So what did Skinner say?
He said that the F.B.I. has nothing to hide,
and neither do we.
If it makes you feel any better, I'm not entirely convinced...
that we're looking for a werewolf anymore.
- Oh. All right. Good. - Yeah, it's something else.
I'm not sure what. Some other kind of creature though.
- I have a... Hey, what's going on?
Six blocks from here. Could be what we're looking for.
No. You go with someone else.
Man down at the corner of...
Guys, watch out. I'm a doctor.
Oh, man, it's Ricky.
That's what I was afraid of, Scully.
When a fellow officer goes down in the line of duty,
or even if it's... even if it's not a fellow officer...
if it's just somebody working part-time with the department...
in a support, uh...
artistic capacity...
like Ricky there... we all feel it.
Uh, that there is every cop's worst nightmare.
But that's when you gotta cowboy up and give 150 percent...
and catch the bad guys.
Last call from his phone was made to the Road Club.
Ricky called in requesting roadside assistance for his flat tire.
He asked them to hurry. He said he didn't feel safe.
- What's that? - Our suspect, apparently.
- The slash marks match up pretty well,
wouldn't you say?
Somebody lost a nail.
Nice color.
Check out this color, Mulder.
Blood red.
Hey, uh, who called 911 on this?
-  Steve and Edy? Sergeant Paula.
The Steve and Edy?
They're good folk. They usually call us if there's trouble in the neighborhood.
- Ooh. - Oh, my God! Look at this!
- Look at all these people. Lord! - How are you doin' this evening?
Not with me lookin' like this. Mm-mmm.
Now, you should know better than that, Sergeant Paula!
Like she gonna run from a camera. Look it here.
We heard all this screamin', peeked out the window,
and this boy with crazy hair was having a conniption fit...
all rolled up there by the phone.
You didn't see his... his attacker?
- Mmm. - I'm ready for my close-up.
Ain't nobody care about your scabby ass. This is police business.
- What? - Now, I didn't see...
- What'd you say? Attacker? - Attacker.
Did you see anything...
that looked like this?
- Ooh, stop! - Or this?
- Ooh! Excuse me? - That's gonna give me nightmares.
- So you didn't see anything at all? - Uh-uh. No.
Did you, uh... Did you see a woman?
- Mmm. Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm.
- Sure do. - Chantara a streetwalker?
- Mm-hmm. She work the corner. - Mm-hmm.
- She on the pipe, so we don't associate. - Oh, yeah.
- Mm-mmm. No. - You know what I'm sayin'?
Well, we should go... We should go talk to Chantara then.
- Well, I wish you would. Mm-hmm. - That's right.
Hey! Hey! When I'm a-get my own TV show?
- If I didn't care - Oh, she's showin' off now.
- More than words can say - Stop! Stop! Get in there! Stop this!
- Would you excuse us? Excuse us. - If I didn't care
Get in there! Stop this! Bye, y'all. Bye.
So apparently, we're on the lookout...
for someone whose hair matches her fingernails.
Bubblegum pink. That would be a good color for you, Scully.
I'd have to say that at this point in the investigation,
I'm-I'm usually a little more secure...
in-in what it is we're actually investigating.
But we've had so many conflicting eyewitness reports...
that it's hard to ascertain exactly what it is we're looking for.
But the crimes we are investigating are... are paranormal.
I can say that...
with absolute conviction.
in any kind of rigorous scientific level, as Agent Scully will tell you.
- Oh, yeah. - Yeah, which in its own way...
is a kind of a validation, if you think about it, in and of itself.
But, you know, that's our job. That's why they pay us the big bucks.
Bubblegum pink.
- Don't run! F.B.I.! - Chantara Gomez?
- Chantara... - Chantara Gomez?
- Don't run! It's okay.
- It's okay.
- It's all right. - Chantara Gomez?
- Can I see your hands, please? - I didn't do nothing!
- Can I see your hands, please? It's okay.
- We need to see your hands. - Show her your hands.
Earlier this evening, a man was attacked. He was badly slashed.
And do you realize that this places you at the crime scene?
Fisher and Delmont. That's your usual hang, isn't it, Chantara?
Look, I heard screaming, okay? And I went and I tried to help this guy.
And when I heard the sirens, I just ran away, okay? I didn't do nothing!
Look, I believe you. I think you saw something.
You witnessed something. Tell me what it is.
- I can't. - You can tell us, Chantara.
- Come on. It's okay. - Chantara.
If you're afraid that what you tell us, we're not gonna believe it, don't be.
So whatever it is you saw tonight,
whatever it is, whatever you think you saw,
however strange or terrifying or bizarre,
you are not gonna surprise me.
Okay?
You'll protect me from Chuko?
- Who's Chuko? - Mi novio.
He's the one who cut that guy up, not me! I didn't do anything!
- I'm sorry. What? - Mi novio. Her boyfriend.
No, I got that.
Look, he's been chasing me for a week, okay?
- Chuko. - Chuko Munos.
The cops know who he is.
This is my favorite part of the job... knockin' down crack houses.
I heard that.
I don't understand. I told you everything you need to know!
- Chantara, first of all, - I just wanna go home now!
He's gonna kill me! You don't understand! He's gonna kill me!
He told me he was gonna twist my neck off like a chicken!
Chantara, no one's gonna kill you.
You see all the deputies here? You see? No one is going to get you.
- Now, what's more, Deputy Wetzel here...
is going to keep an eye on you while we go and put the cuffs on Chuko.
No one is going to get you.
Chuko Munos. The man himself.
Only distinguishing feature is a tattoo on his skull.
- He's not our guy. - What do you mean?
I don't care how bad his rep is, he can't turn over a squad car.
Maybe not by himself, but he's probably got friends, right?
There's something else going on.
Let's hit it.
Units on a warrant. Let's hold all radio traffic.
Go, go, go!
Hands above your head! Get your hands above your head!
- Clear above your head! - Let's see your hands!
- Have you seen Chuko Munos? -  you, mother... [Bleep]
Put your hands on the wall! On the wall!
Get your  hands off me.
Oh, man.
Agents! Agents, in here.
Hey, what happened? Wake up.
- What happened to your friend in there? - Check the tattoo.
- Looks like he O.D. 'd. - Yeah, but how long ago?
Couple days. Maybe a week.
He didn't attack Ricky Kola, that's for sure.
- Shots fired!
- It's here! - What?
- It's gettin'away! - What you got? What you shooting at?
What are you shooting at? Keith, what are you doin'?
It came back. It was here.
-  It-It was here. - Keith!
Oh, man. I heard her screamin', and I tried to...
I tried to stop it. I swear to you, I tried.
- I did everything I could do. - Oh, sh...
I did everything I could do.
What is it, Mulder?
What...
I wish someone would explain to me what the hell is going on here.
It just doesn't make sense.
Keith Wetzel may be a little green, but he is a solid deputy.
Nothing could've gotten past him and killed that woman.
There's no sign of what he was shooting at. This is all we found.
Nine millimeter. It's our issue.
Doesn't look like a ricochet.
Maybe Wetzel hit what he was aiming at. Excuse me.
Hey, Deputy.
You ready to talk to me now?
You and I both know you saw something. We're way past claiming you didn't.
I only know what I thought I saw.
Well, describe it for me.
The Wasp Man.
The Wasp Man?
- It's ridicu... It's ridiculous.
Scary stories my older brother used to tell me when I was a kid...
about a monster, head like a wasp...
and a mouth full of stingers instead of teeth.
He said that it would come get me in my sleep,
and that... and that it would sting me to death.
So you're saying that the Wasp Man attacked you both times...
- Here and earlier in the patrol car? - I...
I'm not saying that that's what it was, okay?
I mean, they didn't see it. It's not on the videotape.
This-This can't be real.
No, I think maybe it can. Just relax a minute. Excuse me.
Scully, we came on this case lookin' for a werewolf, right?
No, you did. That's correct.
Hymen Escallera claimed he was attacked by a werewolf,
and the wounds that he sustained would seem to bear that out, right?
And then, uh, Wetzel over here sees a wasp man...
with stingers for teeth, and he gets a bite mark...
that you say is irrefutably insect-like, right?
Mulder, that's not exactly...
And another eyewitness claims she sees Freddy Krueger.
Scully, what if... what if we're dealing with one creature,
one entity, that when it attacks appears to you as your worst nightmare?
Fear. Maybe that's what this thing feeds on.
how would one catch something like that?
Probably by... by figuring out how it chooses its prey.
I mean, they're... It seems to spread like a contagion.
One person's fear becomes the next. There's a definite chain of victims.
Tonight it went from Mrs. Guerrero to Wetzel and the sketch artist.
And then from the sketch artist to Chantara Gomez.
- And then... Right. - Chantara Gomez back to Wetzel.
- But you're missing someone, Mulder. - Who?
Edy. Steve and Edy.
They're a part of this chain too.
And according to your theory, they would've been attacked, right?
So we're back at the home of Steve and Edy.
We should probably check on them because they seem to fit a victim profile.
I'm sorry. Are you talking to me?
What the hell are... What the hell is this?
Steve, are you gonna be all right?
- I'm all right. Somebody ask if I'm all right.!
I'm the victim! I'm the victim here! He don't treat me right.
- All right. - You better appreciate me, or I'll walk!
He treats my mama with disrespect! He treats me with disrespect!
- See? You! You shut up! - Settle down.
He won't make love to me.
Oh. Uh...
- Oh, no, no! - Look, you guys.
Steve, Edy, the reason why we are here...
is because we are concerned about your safety.
- How's that? - We're concerned about your lives.
You witnessed a violent attack right across the street from your house.
So you say! I just saw a rolled up boy with crazy hair!
Well, take our word for it. Because of your proximity to the attack,
we think you may be targeted as well.
- Why? Because we called the police? - No, no, no.
That's not why. I can't really explain it exactly, but...
I think the key is to remain unemotional, okay?
Try to stay calm. Try to keep your heart rate down.
Try to keep your adrenaline down. Try to...
- Just try to relax. -  Oh, no!
Good luck! You don't know who you're talkin'to about that!
Oh, you!
Yeah, I think maybe we should stay here for a little while.
All right, let's just...
let's just... let's just, uh, relax.
Just relax.
Mr. Mulder, lookee here.
I got to go to bed.
How ya doin', Edy? You still upset?
I'm scared.
You're scared?
I'm scared he's gonna leave me.
Oh!
No, man. No.
You think we should take 'em to a hotel?
- We don't need no hotel. - Mm-mmm.
- Ain't nobody gonna chase us out. - Mm-mmm.
- You're not afraid? - Now, I didn't say that.
I said ain't nobody gonna chase us out.
- Mm-mmm. - No.
Oh, God. More of you?
- Are we any closer to an arrest? - I'm afraid not.
- Mulder, what next? - Well, I'd say...
we should station a couple deputies out here,
but I don't think it's coming back here.
We're just playing catch-up with this thing. It doesn't do what you'd expect.
And, uh... Well, we got four or five hours till the moon sets.
The attacks only occur on a full moon. Then we're out of luck.
Well, I want to examine Chantara Gomez.
-  For a possible contagion? - Your contagion of fear?
- Yeah. No? - No.
Make it fast. And fill that tank up with gas.
Uh, Deputy, you're the only person that's seen this twice,
so I'd like to ride with you if you don't mind.
- Let's go. - Thanks.
You really believe me, huh?
You really believe I saw what I thought I saw?
Yeah, I believe you.
- Why? - Why do I believe you?
Yeah, I mean, what proof do you have what I'm saying is real?
I mean, it's not... it's not on the videotape.
The camera doesn't always tell the whole story.
And what about your partner?
Does she believe me?
I don't think she thinks you're lying.
Yeah, but what? Maybe I'm crazy?
I've been on the job 18 months. It's all I ever wanted to do.
Right out of the gate, I get some kind of rep like I'm crazy.
I mean, you know how cops are.
How's somebody supposed to live that down?
I don't know.
I guess just do good work.
I mean, it's a hard enough job already, you know?
You want to help people, but it's like the freakin' wild west out here.
You know people hate you?
Every shift I go out thinkin'...
Go ahead.
I go out thinkin', "You know, there is somebody out there...
"who wants to take me out.
Am I gonna run into him tonight?"
It's hard to have a fast-track career in law enforcement...
when everybody thinks you're nuts.
Tell me about it.
Chantara Gomez, age 31.
Apparent cause of death is the fracturing...
of the second and third cervical vertebrae.
There are contusions consistent with a choking...
or a throttling by very powerful hands.
People are saying her pimp killed her from beyond the grave.
That's the story going around. It's crazy, huh?
Well, let's see if we can put that story to rest, shall we?
The other thing I heard was, uh,
something about contagion.
- Like, with this body?
That's-That's completely inaccurate.
It's, uh...
The investigation is... We're moving towards an apparent chain of victims.
And I seriously doubt that we're gonna find anything...
that looks like a contagious pathology here.
Because, I mean, if we were, we should be taking precautions.
If the body could be contagious, you...
We're not even wearing masks.
Look, this is obviously a murder here.
I mean, this woman died of a broken neck, right?
Not the hantavirus.
- Who said anything about the hantavirus? - Nobody.
I just... I was, um... It was a figure of speech.
The reason I ask is, why is it so urgent...
to do an autopsy at 3:00 in the morning?
I mean, that kind of rush. It's just unheard of.
We are trying to look for the killer.
We got murder victims stacked three deep in the freezer.
Plus, you got this camera crew recording everything. Why?
Because the F.B.I. has nothing to hide.
Look, there is no ulterior motive here.
It's...
Are you gonna help me out here or what?
Yeah, of course.
Thank you.
Why did you mention the hantavirus?
- Look, I...
Oh, my God.
- Call 911. Call 911!
911! Get out of here! Come on!
It's not the hantavirus.
It looks for all the world like the hantavirus,
but I can promise you that it's not.
Well, I mean, she exhibited all the symptoms...
the hemorrhagic fever, the severe chills, acute shock...
I mean, the thing is that they all developed in a matter of seconds.
And the hantavirus doesn't kill that fast.
I mean, no virus in the world kills that fast.
You were talking about the hantavirus right before she died?
- Why? - Because she kept bringing it up.
I mean, it was like the power of suggestion, Mulder.
She was standing there. She was saying that she was afraid of contagion.
And then all of a sudden, she just...
She was afraid. She was afraid,
and her fear killed her in the worst possible way that she could imagine.
- And what do you mean by that? - It's the same.
It's the same M.O., what we've been looking for all night.
No, Mulder. I was standing right here.
I didn't see anything. They didn't see anything.
Yeah, but you weren't afraid.
The hell I wasn't afraid. I don't know what's going on here.
No, you weren't afraid for your life.
Neither were Steve and Edy, and it left them alone.
Mortal fear. I think that's what it comes down to.
This thing, whatever it is, is attracted to that.
Everybody who was attacked felt that intensely.
- For  sakes. - No, no, no. It makes perfect sense.
You asked me earlier, "What would this thing be doing in Willow Park?"
Well, where else would it go but a high-crime neighborhood?
- Where's Deputy Wetzel? - Back on patrol.
Mulder, you were... you were walking around with him for three hours.
- You didn't see anything? - No, no. But I was with him.
I was backing him up.
Like I said, there's something about a full moon.
Things definitely get strange.
Well, we checked everyplace else tonight.
Let's check this place again.
Aw! Come on.
God...
- I'm callin' for backup.
Get out! Get out now! Get out!
- It won't open! - Let's go! I got it! I got it!
- Come on! I can't open it! - Oh, God!
Oh...
That's Wetzel's car.
- Wetzel! - Get the battering ram.
Let's go around back.
That gun's not gonna do ya any good.
That's the battering ram.
Well, how come they're not in yet?
- Wind? - If you say so.
- I wonder who's in there.
Damn!
- I hate you guys. - Where's Wetzel?
We don't know. There's something out there.
- Stay where you are. -  yeah!
Look at this. Scully.
- Deputy Wetzel? -  Scully!
Have you found him?
Wetzel?
- Wetzel?
- Wetzel!
- Wetzel! - Help me! Please help me!
Wetzel, don't be afraid!
- It can't hurt you! Don't be afraid!
- That's what it wants! Look... Wetzel! - Help me!
It can't hurt you! You're a sheriff s deputy, Wetzel!
Don't be afraid now! You're on national television, so cowboy up!
Jeez!
Wetzel.
He's alive.
-  Deputy Wetzel!
We're up here!
What happened?
The sun just came up.
Hang in there, kid.
Do you think the deputy stopped it, whatever it was?
Maybe it just went away until the next full moon.
I don't know. You gotta figure there's enough fear in the world...
that if it doesn't show up in Willow Park, it's gonna show up someplace else.
You didn't get the proof that you wanted, Mulder.
Well, hey, it all depends on how they edit it together.
This is gonna be a hard one to write up.
132 at Bush. I've got him at gunpoint.
Okay, gunpoint. 132 and Bush. Cover's code three.

Time passes in moments...
moments which rushing past...
define the path of a life...
just as surely as they lead towards its end.
How rarely do we stop to examine that path...
to see the reasons why all things happen.
To consider whether the path we take in life is our own making,
or simply one into which we drift with eyes closed.
But what if we could stop, pause to take stock...
of each precious moment before it passes?
Might we then see the endless forks in the road that have shaped a life?
And seeing those choices,
choose another path?
I see the storm has broken...
in the middle of the night.
Nothing left here for me.
It's washed away.
The rain pushes the buildings aside.
- I got the lab to rush the results of... - The sky turns...
- I heard you, Scully. - Szezesny did indeed drown.
What else could she have possibly drowned in?
Margarita mix.
Upchucked with about 40 ounces of Corcovado Gold tequila, which...
as it turns out, she and her friends rapidly consumed in the woods...
while trying to reenact The Blair Witch Project.
I think that demands a little deeper investigation, don't you?
No, I don't.
Well, it doesn't matter, 'cause we got bigger fish to fry.
Have a seat, Scully. Check this out.
- Is that beautiful or what? - Crop circles, Mulder?
Computer-generated crop circles.
It's a fractal image predicted by a computer program using data...
of every known occurrence of the phenomena over the past 40 years.
What most people don't realize is that since 1991...
- There's been a dramatic increase...
in size and complexity of circle designs.
That's when the Mandlebrot Set appeared in England...
a series of geometrically perfect rings appearing almost impossibly overnight...
in a field near Cambridge.
But that was merely prelude of what was to come.
Three years later in 1994,
even more complex formations occurred simultaneously...
on opposite ends of the English countryside with the Mandlebrot Set,
where it's still there at its center.
Then in 1997, even more complex formations occurred.
And I'm not wearing any pants right now.
- Hmm? - You're not listening.
I am.
I guess I just don't see the point.
The point is that a computer program has shown us...
that these are not just random happenstance coincidental occurrences.
And that same program has predicted that in just 48 hours...
even more complex formations are gonna be laid down in a field near Avebury.
Mulder, I still have to go over to the hospital and...
finish the final paperwork on that autopsy you had me do.
And to be honest, it's Saturday.
And I wouldn't mind, I don't know, taking a bath.
And besides, what could you possibly get out of this?
Or learn? I mean, it's not even remotely FBI related.
I'll just cancel your ticket.
Thanks for lunch.
Mulder. Look, we're always running.
We're always chasing the next big thing.
Why don't you ever just stay still?
I wouldn't know what I'd be missing.
My name is Dana Scully...
It's for the FBI.
Let's see. Oh.
And just sign here, please.
Thank you.
Hi. Um, I was given the wrong test results.
This X ray marked D. Waterston was in the envelope marked Szezesny.
I was expecting autopsy results.
I'm sorry. They must have gotten switched.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
Thank you.
Is the, um... Is the D. Waterston that was on the X ray,
is that a Dr. Daniel Waterston?
Waterston, Waterston. Yes, it is.
Admitted yesterday, coronary care unit, room 306.
Thank you.
I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say.
Everything appears to be as it should,
under the circumstances.
So, don't worry.
If you'd like, I could show you the hospital cafeteria.
Uh, I guess... Yeah, okay.
Are there phones down there too? I need to make some phone calls.
Yes.
- Excuse me. Can I help you with something?
Uh, I'm sorry. I'm Dr. Scully. I was just in the hospital and...
Can we step into the hallway?
Yeah.
I'm Dr. Waterston's cardiologist, Paul Kopeikan. You say your name was Scully?
Uh, yes, Dana Scully.
- Dr. Waterston's mentioned you. - I'm sorry. You must be mistaken.
You were a student of his, right?
He has a heart condition?
Dr. Waterston came in yesterday with severe chest pains.
And he ordered us to do an echocardiogram...
and a biopsy because he'd had symptoms...
of an upper respiratory infection the week before.
Fortunately, it was the right call.
- Then it's serious. - But treatable.
That's all right. But thanks for your time.
He must have been a wonderful teacher.
I've been following his work on constrictive pericarditis for years now.
Yes.
He's a remarkable man.
- Hello? -  You came to see him.
I'm sorry. Who is this?
- Margaret Waterston. - Maggie.
Is everything all right?
- Well, that depends, doesn't it? - I'm sorry?
Whatever. Dr. Kopeikan told my father you were here, and now he wants to see you.
- About what? - Look.
He asked me to call, so I'm calling.
I don't know, Maggie. I-I... I don't know if I've got time.
- Don't know if you have the time.
Hello?
I'll never see you again.
- Hello? - Hey, you're there?
I got a 5:30 flight, remember?
Right. I guess I lost track of time.
Listen, the reason I called... Am I catching you at a bad time?
No, I just walked in. Why?
There's this group in D.C. that is researching crop circles,
- Mulder, I'm not going. - I gotta ask you a favor.
One of the researchers lives out near the hospital...
So I was wondering if you would go over there and, you know,
and get it and put it in...
Speak to me, Scully.
I'm out for the evening, Mulder.
Why don't you leave that address on my answering machine...
and, uh, I'll try it for you.
I'm sorry. I... I have the wrong room.
That's okay.
Hi.
Do I have to lock eyes with the devil for you to grace me with your presence?
Surely not the devil.
How are you feeling, Daniel?
It's a real drag when the body doesn't wanna play anymore.
You're extremely lucky you called that diagnosis.
Luck has nothing to do with it, Dana.
That's what doctors do every day. You may have forgotten that.
Daniel.
So, how did you happen to be here in Washington?
That's a long story.
- How's the FBI? - Is that why you wanted to see me?
To remind me once again what a bad choice I made?
Believe me, my motivation is far more selfish than that.
You scare me, Daniel.
I know.
I scare you...
because I represent that which is ingrained,
not only in your mind, but in your heart...
that which you secretly long for.
You never accepted my reason for leaving.
It wasn't a reason. It was an excuse.
But you understood why.
I can't believe the FBI is a passion.
Not like medicine.
I'm sorry I came.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
I know how difficult it must have been for you,
just walking through that door.
But you wouldn't have come if you didn't want to.
That says something, doesn't it?
I got that address that I wanted you to go to for me.
It's a woman you're gonna be dealing with.
She's affiliated with American Daoist Healing Center.
- She researches crop circles? - Don't roll your eyes, Scully.
-  Mulder.
You want me to...
Scully?
Scully, are you there?
Hi. I'm... You were...
- At the hospital today. - Right.
That's strange.
I'm Agent Scully. I'm here on behalf of my partner.
- About my research. - For the FBI, as odd as that may sound.
- I think I need some fresh air. - Are you all right?
Yes, I... I mean, yes, I... I'm just a little shaken.
A near car accident, I think. It's nothing, really.
A car accident isn't nothing.
- I'm sorry? - In my experience,
they're often the end results of us not paying attention to something.
Look, I don't mean to be rude, but I really don't have much time.
Sure. I'll go get my papers.
You think what we do is a little ridiculous, don't you?
Uh, to be honest, I don't exactly know what it is that you do.
But you've already formed a judgment about it.
I really should be going.
There is a greater intelligence in all things.
Accidents, or near accidents,
often remind us that we need to keep our mind open...
to the lessons it gives.
You may wanna slow down.
Hello?
Ah, Hurricane Scully has arrived.
I guarantee you, Doctor, you're doing it right.
But I can't be responsible for treatment that might exacerbate your illness.
There hasn't even been a double-blind analysis of prednisone's effect.
Prednisone?
There. An informed opinion.
You come off so rational, but maybe you know less than you think.
She's, uh, been through some difficult times.
And she's very angry.
How did she even find out?
There are things you don't know...
things I'm not proud of.
What things?
I screwed up, Dana.
Things got bad at home after...
It was hard for me...
when you walked away.
I shut down from my family.
Needless to say, it was very difficult for Barbara.
You divorced.
Only after an interminable period of discomfort for us both.
Where did you go?
Here. Washington.
When?
Almost ten years ago.
Daniel,
you didn't move here for me?
I didn't mean for it to happen this way, of course.
Oh, God.
You've come at such a strange time.
I know. I know. You... You have a life.
I don't know what I have.
Your X rays were in the wrong envelope.
I never would have even known you were here if it wasn't for a mix-up.
It's just...
What do you want, Dana?
I want everything I should want at this time of my life.
Maybe I want a life I didn't choose.
Nurse!
We have a code in here!
Nurse!
Code blue, CCU. Code blue, CCU.
He's in V-fib. Get his head.
- In! - In.
- Two hundred joules! - Two hundred.
- All clear? - Clear.
- No pulse, no resps. - Three hundred joules.
- Three hundred charge. - Clear!
Clear.
- Who's paying attention? - Ready.
- Clear! - Clear.
We have a pulse.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hi. Can I help you?
Uh, I'm looking for Colleen.
- Okay. Bye. - Bye.
- I'm surprised to see you again. - I'm sorry I was rude before.
I'm a medical doctor and a scientist.
And you're right, I don't know what it is that you do.
But there was something that you said that I wanted to ask you about.
About slowing down.
Would you like to sit down?
Please.
I have a friend who's ill.
And, uh, I had a strange feeling today,
just a short while ago, actually,
that he may be dying from a more serious condition than anyone realizes.
You sense something.
Holistic practitioners believe, as do many Eastern religions,
that living beings exist beyond the physical dimensions of time and space.
That we're composed of layers of energy and consciousness.
You've probably heard it referred to as an aura.
- Mmm, yes. - Witness this energy field...
and truths come out that have little to do with scientific proof...
and much to do with faith.
What are you saying that I saw?
Pain.
And where there's pain, there's a need for healing...
physically, mentally or spiritually.
But he has a heart condition.
When we hold onto shame and guilt and fear,
it creates imbalance.
It makes us forget who we are.
This is difficult for you to accept.
Would you like to have some tea?
Have you ever had moments when everything gets incredibly clear?
When time seems to expand?
Yes.
That's so strange.
You may be more open to things than you think.
It's just a matter of what you do with it.
I used to be a physicist.
I was successful in my field working 80 odd hours a week.
I thought I was happy. Truth is I was cut off from the world...
and from myself.
I was literally dying inside.
I was in a relationship with Carol, who you met,
but I was so afraid of what the world and my family...
and my fellow scientists would think that I told no one.
Then two years ago, I was diagnosed with breast cancer.
- I'm sorry. -  Don't be.
It's the cancer that got my attention.
It stopped me from being on the self-destructive path I was on.
It made me realize I was in a field that had little meaning for me...
Huh. But how?
I was introduced to a healer who helped me see the disease for what it was.
It wasn't until I began releasing shame and telling the truth...
that my cancer went into remission.
You still aren't sure.
Everything happens for a reason.
- Are you happy? - I'm sorry.
I... I was just going up to see your father.
- You can't. He's in a coma. - Since when?
Since about two minutes after you supposedly saved his life.
Do you have any idea the hell you've created in our lives?
Maggie, to be honest, I left so there wouldn't be hell in your lives.
Don't try to be reasonable with me. I am so sick of being reasonable.
You moved on, but we've had to live with what you left behind.
What I try to do is clear the body's energy channels,
what we call chakras,
which can become barriers to a doctor's ability to effectively heal the patient.
When these channels are working improperly,
whether from poor physical or emotional health,
the block serves to create conditions for disease.
If I can unblock the energy early on,
then I can prevent the onset or escalation of an illness...
What's going on here?
Dr. Scully, who do you think you are?
We have nothing but Dr. Waterston's welfare in mind here.
- You're not his doctor. - I understand that.
What's taking place here is an alternative approach.
What's taking place here is a waste of time, Dr. Scully.
And I think Dr. Waterston would be the first to agree with me.
Have you considered that?
I just wanted to help him. It seemed like nothing else was working.
All due respect, that is not for you to assess.
That is for me or Dr. Waterston's family to decide.
Then let 'em continue.
If it isn't hurting him, we should at least be open to it.
I'm afraid there's really nothing more I can do at this time.
This man, quite frankly, is ready to move on.
But something seems to be holding him back.
Unfinished business is binding him to the physical plane.
Something he needs to release...
before he can let go.
Broken up. Pushing us.
Broken up. Pushing us.
Hear the rain fall.
See the wind come to my eyes.
See the storm broken.
Now nothing.
Speak to me, baby, in the middle of the night.
Speak to me.
- Hello. -  It's Maggie.
Daniel.
You think I'd give up so easily?
You were slipping away.
No one thought you'd come out of this.
- I'm still in shock. - Imagine my shock...
when the doctor told me the voodoo ritual you'd arranged for last night.
- I was afraid it didn't work. - Of course it didn't work.
Don't be absurd. Where'd you get this crap?
Daniel, that crap may have just saved your life,
whether you're open to it or not.
It doesn't matter. I don't wanna talk about that.
Look at me.
I'm gonna get well.
And we need to talk about what happens next for us.
I spoke at length to Maggie.
It's time...
that you took responsibility for the hurt you caused in your family.
It's no accident that you got sick, Daniel.
You've been running from the truth for ten years.
Dana, it was only to be with you.
You were all I lived for.
Maybe the reason you're alive now is to make up for that...
to make it up to Maggie.
- That's Maggie talking, not you. - No.
I'm not the same person, Daniel.
I wouldn't have known that if I hadn't seen you again.
Excuse me!
Hey.
- Mulder? - I was just looking for you.
But you're supposed to be in England.
- I'm back. - What happened?
Nothing. There was no event, no crop circles.
- Big waste of time.
Maybe sometimes nothing happens for a reason, Mulder.
What is that supposed to mean?
Nothing.
Come on. I'll make you some tea.
I just find it hard to believe.
I didn't say my whole life changed.
You speaking to God in a Buddhist temple. God speaking back?
Now, I didn't say that God spoke back.
I said that I had some kind of a vision.
Well, for you that's like saying you're having David Crosby's baby.
What is it?
I once considered spending my whole life with this man.
What I would have missed.
I don't think you can know.
We... We don't know.
What if there was only one choice...
and all the other ones were wrong...
and there were signs along the way to pay attention to?
Then all the... choices...
would then lead to this very moment.
One wrong turn and...
we wouldn't be sitting here together.
Now, that says a lot.
It says a lot, a lot, a lot.

Now I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
If I die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take.
God bless Mommy, God bless Daddy,
and Grandma and Grandpa LaPierre,
and Grandma and Grandpa Jason, and...
Okay, okay, Amber Lynn. Bedtime. Come on.
You grab Mike, okay? Hop in.
Let's get you cozy, cozy, toasty, toasty.
Inside. Snug as a bug.
- Night-night, Lynnie. - Night-night, Daddy.
- Night, Mommy. - Night, love.
Bed lights out, Amber Lynn.
Good girl. That's a good girl.
Stop right there!
- Weapon on the floor. - This is great.
Where's this trial I'm being put through?
Is this a test of my love for you?
Billie?
- They are the ones that want me to kill myself.
Aah!
Oh, sweet angel.
Billie! Amber Lynn!
Oh, God!
Amber Lynn LaPierre, that's right.
A federal investigation is underway.
The kidnapping in Sacramento, California.
- Why are you here, Agent Mulder? - I want this case.
I'm fairly certain I've got more than enough competent agents in here.
- Ooh, I can see that. - This is a kidnapping, Agent Mulder.
A little girl snatched from her bedroom. Basic, missionary-style F.B.I. work.
- It's not an X-File. - I'm aware of the facts.
That's what I'm talking about, ruling out other possibilities.
I can't just give you the case.
I have to follow protocol.
Behavioral gets first crack, then the people down at N.C.N.E.C.
Two, three, four hours.
This case is gonna be a circus. Every starstruck attorney in America...
is gonna want to represent these people for free.
You've got till noon. Mulder...
the agents in my office... they have a pool going.
They think she's dead.
Don't bet on it.
Sir, can you tell us about...
Excuse me. Have they found the girl?
Are there any new developments in the case? Is she dead?
Are the parents suspects in the disappearance of their daughter?
Sorry, no press allowed inside.
Special Agent Fox Mulder, F.B.I.
Uh, Harry Bring. How can I help you?
Mr. Bring, your card says "real estate law and conveyances."
Have you ever handled a murder case?
- This isn't a murder case. - Well, it might as well be...
once the facts about Amber Lynn's disappearance get out.
My clients are not murderers, and-and I resent any such accusation.
You know, if you really want to help your clients, get them a real lawyer.
It's okay, Harry.
- Billie and I got nothin' to hide.
Mr. And Mrs. LaPierre, my name is Fox Mulder.
I'm a special agent with the F.B.I.
I have a lot of experience with crimes like the one that took place here.
I know you've made a statement to the police,
but I'd like to ask you some questions about that.
I want to ask you about the note you found.
Where did you find it?
- In my daughter's bedroom. - When?
When I went to check on her.
- Do you know what time that was? - 9:30, I think.
It was right about then.
- I was watching TV in here. - What were you watching?
I never heard of it before. It was good.
What about you, Mrs. LaPierre?
- I was in bed already. - Were you asleep?
Half.
Is that Amber Lynn's bedroom that I saw down the hallway there?
Yes.
Do you always lock your doors at night, even if you're home?
Yes.
You know most of your neighbors, I bet, up and down the street.
- You're on good terms with them? - Most of them, yes.
Can you think of anyone who might've wanted to hurt Amber Lynn?
That's enough questions. They've been very helpful,
but I think you can see that these folks have nothing whatsoever to hide.
Mr. And Mrs. LaPierre, I want you to understand something,
because it's gonna get very confusing from here on in.
But whatever else the F.B.I. says or does,
they're gonna try their damnedest to find your little girl.
- Okay. - Thank you.
Agent Mulder?
Do you think they will... find her?
Oh, I hope so.
Yeah. I really do.
It's open.
Mulder?
Come on in.
- What are you doing? - Thinkin'.
- About? - Amber Lynn LaPierre.
- Mind if I turn on a light? - Yeah. I do.
Skinner is royally pissed.
- At you. - I'm sure he is.
He expected a report at noon.
He waited. And now he sent me to find you to get it.
- I don't have a report. - They had to move on the case.
The media got wind of the police findings. They're gonna broadcast them.
The parents are being held for further questioning.
- They're not guilty, Scully. - The facts would say otherwise.
There's no sign of a break-in.
Both of the parents were at home at the time the girl disappeared.
They lied about where they found the note.
- Why? - That's what I've been thinkin' about.
She's not dead, Scully.
- Mulder. -  Fox, it's me.
- Mom? Hi. - I'm watching the news.
That little girl in California. You're out there, aren't you?
Yes.
- I am. Are you okay, Mom? - When are you coming back here?
Well, I'm not sure. You know, I don't know.
- Call when you get back, Fox. - Okay, I will.
Um...
You take care, Mom, okay?
From the note, we can and have determined several facts.
There is a threat of physical violence, but no demand for money or ransom.
The note is short and written on a torn piece of paper,
suggesting haste and little or no planning.
The paper's the type used by dry cleaners to protect laundered garments.
The torn piece that the note was found on...
matches exactly a piece that was found in the garbage at the LaPierre home.
The ink matches a felt-tip pen that was also found in the garbage.
One set of prints were found on it... Billie LaPierre's prints.
- Is it her handwriting? That's gonna be difficult to prove,
due to the felt-tip pen and the quality of the paper,
which tends to cause bleeding, makes the handwriting indistinct.
It also looks like there's been an attempt to disguise the writing.
By using samples of Mrs. LaPierre's handwriting,
we see dominant letter forms... the "S" in "strangle,"
"stray dog, " here in "Santa Claus. "
Matches up with the "S"'s in "dollars"...
"seven"and "cents. "
- Enough to make a connection. - But not an indictment.
Do you have information you'd like to share with us, Agent Mulder?
Bud LaPierre says he'd been watching television...
and had gotten up to go to bed when he found Amber Lynn missing.
But according to the police report,
the TVset was still on when the first officers arrived on the scene.
By his own account, both mother and father put Amber Lynn to bed...
But no one saw a stranger on a Friday...
at a fairly early hour enter into a locked and lighted home...
and remove this little girl undetected.
- Husband's lying for his wife. - I don't think so.
Why?
Because that doesn't explain what happened to this little girl.
What are you doing, Mulder?
There's something in that abduction note that I've seen before.
That's not what I mean.
You're personalizing this case. You're identifying with your sister.
My sister was taken by aliens. Did I say anything about aliens?
What did I do? I provided a logical counterpoint.
Pocatello, Idaho, 1987.
Look familiar?
Kathy Lee, visitors are here.
- Can you let them in, please?
Hi, Ms. Tencate. My name is Agent Mulder. This is Agent Scully.
Can we have a seat?
It's not the Ritz.
Um... we just have a few questions.
We've reviewed the facts of your case. The facts seem to speak for themselves.
Your six-year-old son Dean was taken from his bed while he slept.
A note was found threatening his life, later determined to be written by you.
You plead innocent at trial, but you were convicted...
and sentenced to 12 years, even though your son's body was never found.
- Yes, that's right. - Your story is that, uh,
on the night your son disappeared, you had a vision of him dead.
You thought it was your mind playing tricks on you,
but when you got up to check on him, he was missing from his bed.
- Is that accurate? - Yes.
Now, three years ago, after seven years of incarceration,
you changed your story and confessed to the murder of your son...
in a fit of insanity, a psychotic break.
- Yes, that's right. - Why did you do it?
I don't know. I was full of rage.
I have a... copy of the note that you wrote.
Do you mind if I show it to you?
Now, there's a phrase down here at the bottom.
"No one shoots at Santa Claus."
Can you explain what that means to me?
Uh... It means that, uh,
when someone promises you something, a gift, like Santa Claus,
that no one would do anything for fear of not getting the gift.
A little girl disappeared from her bed three days ago.
This is the note that was left at that scene.
Can you take a look at that and tell me what it says at the bottom?
Same thing.
Neither note makes a specific demand.
In both cases, there is no evidence of foul play or break-in.
And, as in your son's case, there is no body to be found.
- I told them where the body was. - Yes, you did.
- I think you can. - I can't!
You can't explain it because you didn't do anything.
You didn't kill your son, and you didn't bury him.
You're not guilty of anything other than a lie, just like these people.
The only reason you changed your story was to get outta here.
Because you knew the parole board might buy the story...
of a psychotic break and of your terrible remorse.
These people...
they need someone to tell them it's okay,
someone to corroborate their story.
- I'm not that person. - They need your help.
That was utterly irresponsible, Mulder.
It was out of line and it was without any basis in reality.
I can't explain it, Mulder, but you're doing exactly what I said.
- You're personalizing this case. - No. I'm gonna solve this case.
- I am gonna solve it. - How?
I'm gonna find those kids.
What if they're dead, Mulder?
Don't go looking for something you don't wanna find.
Guard? Guard, please, can you get them back?
Guard? I need to talk.
This is Fox Mulder. Leave a message. I'll try to get back to you.
Fox, it's your mother.
There are so many emotions in me, I wouldn't know where to start.
So much that I've left unsaid for reasons I hope...
one day you'll understand.
This is highly unusual. I wanna know what you're doing here.
Something I want your clients to see.
I wanna know what it is first.
I believe you share a secret.
I'm, uh...
I'm doing this because I feel that it's the right thing to do,
and because I know what you're going through.
I wouldn't want to happen to you what happened to me.
I just want to tell you that your little girl is okay.
And I know you're afraid of the truth, because I...
I saw things that I was afraid of too.
And I can't explain all of it, except to say...
that I don't remember...
ever... thinking those words that I wrote, let alone writing them.
It was like they wrote themselves using my hand.
But what I know...
for sure, because I feel it in my heart,
is that my son is safe and protected...
and in a better place.
Rumors and suspicions aside,
the parents of Amber Lynn LaPierre...
were released today for lack of evidence against them,
and after giving a new statement to the Sacramento police, which insiders say...
has authorities still baffled and confused, recounting a detailed story...
that claims supernatural forces were at work when their daughter was abducted.
The LaPierres, seen here returning to their home, declined comment.
Federal investigation of the case will continue,
but will no longer focus on the LaPierres as primary suspects.
We, uh, we will intensify our search for Amber Lynn,
and we remain hopeful of her eventual safe return.
"Intensify our search" where? The Twilight Zone?
- I have a corroborating witness. - In state prison.
There's a material connection between these two women.
The only connection, Agent Mulder, is you.
I've got people busting their butts on this thing,
putting together hard evidence, real evidence,
while you're out gathering Grimm's Fairy Tales from convicted murderers.
I deal in the real world, Agent Mulder.
You begged onto this case as part of the solution.
All you've done is hand our only suspects the Twinkie defense.
- Sir. - What? What is it, Agent Scully?
- I need to have a word with Agent Mulder. - It can wait.
- No, it can't, sir. - What is it, Scully?
Mulder, your mom's dead.
- Mulder? - In here.
- What is it? - Diazapan.
She used them to sleep.
- Was there a note? - No.
She called when I was in California. She wanted to talk,
but, uh, I never called her back.
Oh, Mulder...
I didn't... Why would she do this?
It just doesn't make any sense.
- We never truly know why. - No. She wouldn't kill herself.
Why are these pictures gone?
There were photos here. There were photos of my sister and I.
This is all she had left of us, and they're missing. Why...
She saw me on the news. She wanted to talk about the missing girl, Amber Lynn.
She wanted to tell me something about her.
Maybe she couldn't tell me over the phone,
'cause she was afraid that they would do something like this to her.
- Who? - Whoever took my sister.
Look at this place. I mean, it's like it's all staged.
The pills, the oven, the tape. It's like a bad movie script.
They would've come here, and they would've threatened her.
She would be upset. They would have to sedate her. I would look for a, uh...
a needle-puncture mark or something else in her system besides these pills.
No, Mulder. Please don't ask me to do this.
- Scully, who else can I ask? - An autopsy, Mulder?
It's one thing on a stranger, but you're my friend and she's your mother.
I know. But if you don't do it, I might never know the truth.
You've seen things.
I need to understand them.
Something's happened to you?
My mother's dead.
You know why.
Look, I can help you. I can talk to the parole board for you.
But right now, I need you to help me.
- I don't understand what you want. - I'm not here by accident.
My sister was taken away from me...
when she was eight years old, like your son was taken away from you.
- Where's your sister now? - I don't know.
- Your mother knew, didn't she? - Why do you ask that?
- She was trying to tell you. - Tell me what?
- She'd seen them. - Who?
The walk-ins.
Old souls looking for new homes.
Your sister's among them.
- You can see them? - Yes.
But sometimes it's very difficult because they live in the starlight.
- Is my sister dead? - They took her...
to protect her soul from the great harm it would've suffered in her life,
just like they did my little boy.
Where do they take them?
Your boy?
- This little girl, Amber Lynn LaPierre? - I don't know.
But they're okay.
I'm sure your sister's there too.
Come on! I want to see Santa!
Yes!
- That one's fat. - That's not Rudolph!
- This one is dead! He's dead. - He's not! He's not!
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose Like a lightbulb
- You can't sing it! - Yes, I could!
- No, you can't! - I could!
Hey, buddy.
- We're gonna see Santa! - Santa!
Fox, it's your mother.
There are so many emotions in me, I wouldn't know where to start.
So much that I've left unsaid for reasons...
I hope one day you'll understand.
There are so many emotions in me, I wouldn't know where to start.
So much that I've left unsaid for reasons...
I hope one day you'll understand.
I'm glad you're here.
My mother was trying to tell me something.
- Think I've figured it out.
Something about my sister that she was never able to tell me.
So much that I've left unsaid for reasons...
I hope one day you'll understand.
She knew what I'd find with this case out in California.
- How could she know that? - Child disappearing without a trace,
without evidence, in defiance of all logical explanation?
She knew because of what's driven me, what I've always believed.
Mulder...
Scully, these... these parents who have lost...
who've lost their children, they've had visions...
of their sons and daughters...
in scenarios that never happened, but...
which they describe in notes that came through as automatic writing,
My mother must've written a note like that herself...
describing the scenario of my...
sister's disappearance, of her abduction by aliens.
Don't you see, Scully? It never happened.
All these visions that I've had have just been...
they've been to help me cope, to help me deal with the loss, but...
I've been looking for my sister in the wrong place.
That's... what my mother was trying to tell me.
That's what she was trying to warn me about.
That's why they killed her.
Your mother killed herself, Mulder.
I conducted the autopsy.
She was dying of an incurable disease...
an untreatable and horribly disfiguring disease called Paget's carcinoma.
She knew it. There were doctors' records.
She didn't wanna live.
She was trying to tell me something!
She was...
She was trying to tell you to stop...
to stop looking for your sister.
She was just trying to take away your pain.
- Hi. - Hi.
- How's he doing? - It's been a hard night for him.
Billie LaPierre's asking for him. She's got something to say.
- She'll only talk to Mulder. - It's not a good...
What is it?
This case has heated up. I've booked two flights for us.
Then you better book three.
Honey, wake up.
- He's here. - Hm?
Come in, Agent Mulder.
It's okay. She's here to help.
What happened here, Billie?
I saw my daughter right in this room...
standing right there.
I swear to God, she was right over there...
in the pajamas her grandma gave her...
saying something to me.
- What was she saying? - I don't know.
Her lips were moving, but I couldn't hear.
I thought...
I thought she was saying "74."
74? The number 74? Does that mean anything to you?
74 mean anything to you, Mr. LaPierre?
Let's go home.
Mulder, we just got here.
We're not gonna... find these people's daughter alive.
- How do you know that? - What we're hearing, it's...
the delusional talk of people that don't want to accept the truth.
But you can't see a ghost and still hope to find her alive.
Both things can't be true.
If this little girl's spirit really did appear to her mother,
then there's probably only one explanation.
You think their daughter's dead.
- Well, what about the handwritten note? - I don't know what that means.
I don't know what is the truth and what isn't anymore.
I'm way too close to this case to make any kind of sound judgment.
In fact, I would like to ask for you to let me off this case, please,
and I'd like to take some time off.
What is it?
- Santa Claus. - What?
Stop. Turn around.
Some of these tapes go back to the '60s.
I think I know what we're gonna find here.
It's what my mother was afraid of... my sister.
It's Amber Lynn LaPierre.
This tape is dated two days before her disappearance.
Hey!
- Stop!
Keep your hands up!
- What's your name? - Ed Truelove.
You're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent.
If you give up the right to remain silent, anything you say...
can and will be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to speak with an attorney...
and to have your attorney present during questioning.
If you so desire and cannot afford one...
Scully.

They said the birds refused to sing...
and the thermometer fell suddenly,
as if God himself had his breath stolen away.
No one there dared speak aloud,
as much in shame as in sorrow.
They uncovered the bodies one by one.
The eyes of the dead were closed,
as if waiting for permission to open them.
Were they still dreaming of ice cream and monkey bars,
of birthday cake and no future but the afternoon?
Or had their innocence been taken along with their lives,
buried in the cold earth so long ago?
These fates seemed too cruel, even for God to allow.
Or are the tragic young born again when the world's not looking?
I wanna believe so badly in a truth beyond our own,
hidden and obscured from all but the most sensitive eyes.
In the endless procession of souls,
in what cannot and will not be destroyed,
I want to believe we are unaware of God's eternal recompense and sadness...
that we cannot see his truth.
That that which is born still lives and cannot be buried in the cold earth,
but only waits to be born again at God's behest...
where in ancient starlight we lay...
in repose.
Ed Truelove was 19 when he committed his first murder.
He was working as a janitor at an elementary school...
and they needed someone to play Santa Claus.
He never got over the feelings it aroused.
He's admitted to all of it, Mulder...
24 separate murders.
But he refuses to take blame for Amber Lynn LaPierre.
I was just handed the preliminary forensics report.
Her body was not one of those found in the graves.
Mulder, I know you wanted to find her out there.
He's got hours of video of her.
I'm talking about your sister.
- I know that's who you're looking for. - Yeah.
You don't know how badly I wanted her to be in one of those graves.
I guess I just want it to be over.
-  Agent Mulder, Scully.
There's a Mr. Harold Piller here to see you.
- Mr. Piller? - Agent Mulder.
- Agent Scully. - Do we know each other?
Not personally, no. But I'm happy to meet you. Hi. Harold Piller.
Mr. Piller, are you part of this investigation?
Yes, I hope to be.
- How can we help you? - I was hoping to help you.
You're a police psychic.
My references are on the back.
I've gotten some strong hits off this case.
You're looking for a little girl,
but she's not among the dead.
Your suspect is going to say he didn't kill her.
Did he?
No. I think I can help find her.
Mr. Piller, you have some interesting references here.
You've worked with law enforcements in Kashmir, India, Myanmar,
Afghanistan, Pakistan, Khyber Pass.
That was a train wreck... a horrible tragedy.
They called me in to locate the bodies of seven children who were unrecovered.
- And did you recover them? - I didn't recover them, no.
- But I explained what happened. - What happened?
The children's bodies were transported from the accident site...
by a spiritual intervention, what are known as walk-ins.
Thank you, Mr. Piller, but we have real work to be done.
I've studied this phenomenon the world over...
at mud slides in Peru, earthquakes in Uzbekistan.
Kids' bodies never found, never accounted for in any other way.
What happened to them?
The bodies were transported from the various sites...
in starlight.
Please excuse us. Mulder?
- Mulder, please. - What is it?
Mulder, you have been through so much in such a short time...
You're vulnerable right now.
But this man isn't gonna help us find her, by his own admission.
It's not the first time I've heard what he's saying...
about the intervention of these walking spirits.
Kathy Lee Tencate mentioned it to me in the prison.
- She said that's who took her son. - Because it's foolproof, Mulder.
Nobody is gonna disprove it if there's no body.
And that's exactly what this man does.
He gives a comforting explanation at a train wreck...
or an earthquake that everyone can live with.
But the fact is the bodies are still buried.
Or maybe they are somewhere else.
Like your sister?
Mulder,
you told me that all you wanted was for this to be over.
I do.
I do.
Well, then I'm going back to Washington.
There's nothing more to be done here.
How long have you been doing this?
A few years.
I have a son who disappeared under strange circumstances.
He's never been found.
And then one day, I just... started to see them.
These walk-ins, you say they...
they come and take the children.
- Why? - In almost every case,
the parents had a precognitive image...
of their child dead.
Horrible visions.
I believe what this is is the work of good spirits...
foretelling their fates.
A fate the child was about to meet,
a particularly violent fate that wasn't meant to be.
Which is why the spirits intervened,
transforming matter into pure energy.
Starlight.
But it's not what happened here.
How do you know that?
Because these children all died suffering,
pleading innocently for their lives.
These beautiful children, so... trusting and pure.
I see them.
My God, why?
Why must some suffer and not others?
You see them? Do you see Amber Lynn LaPierre?
She wasn't here. She never was.
But I'm... I'm sensing a connection with her...
to this place.
No, it's a connection to...
- It's a connection to you. - How's that?
You lost someone close to you.
Ayoung girl.
It happened a... a long time ago.
Your sister.
There's a connection between these girls, isn't there?
Between her and Amber Lynn?
What is the connection?
I don't know.
But we're going to find them. I'm sure of it.
I'm going to count backwards now, Fox.
And you'll fall into a deep relaxed state...
so that you'll remember all about your sister and what happened.
One hundred, ninety-nine,
ninety-eight,
ninety-seven,
ninety-six...
Where are you now, Fox?
I'm at home... my mom and dad's.
We're in the den playing a game.
Who are you there with?
Samantha.
- Do you feel in any danger? - No.
Pieces on the board are fallin' off...
Here I became suspicious.
-  Samantha? - Suspicious of what?
In 30 years with the F.B.I., you think you've seen it all.
I sometimes think I have.
But this is just a garden variety compensatory abduction fantasy.
Compensatory for what?
His guilt. His fear.
Everything that's preventing Agent Mulder...
from remembering the truth about what really happened that night.
You mean his sister wasn't abducted?
No, his sister definitely went missing in 1973. That's not in dispute.
Agent Mulder, however, wasn't regressed until 1989.
See, his delusion is playing into his unconscious hope...
that his sister is still alive.
And if you think about it, his delusion has the effect...
of giving him reason to pursue her.
But why alien abduction?
Close Encounters, E. T., who knows?
But there was probably a lot of imagery collecting in his head...
in those 16 years.
And then he comes down here, and he finds the X-Files.
So what do you think happened to his sister?
Well, in 1973...
we were pretty damned unsophisticated about violent predatory crime.
My guess is she was kidnapped in the house,
her body was disposed of, never found.
You think that his sister's dead?
Have you seen this file?
There was an extraordinary amount of effort put into finding his sister.
Even the treasury department got involved.
His father worked at a high level in the government.
They found nothing.
Why, Agent Scully? Why do you wanna bring all this back up now?
Someone owes it to Mulder.
Word of advice, me to you.
Let it be.
You know, there are some wounds that are just too painful ever to be reopened.
Well, this particular wound has never healed.
And Mulder deserves closure, just like anyone.
Apes evolved from men?
- There's gotta be an answer. - Don't look for it, Taylor.
You may not like what you find.
Untie me!
- What? What are you doing? - I'm picking up something.
- It's 3:00 in the morning. - There's someone here.
- Yeah, the TV is on... - No. A visitor.
They... They wanna speak. They wanna tell us something.
What?
Get a piece of paper.
- And a pen.
No, you.
Shoot.
It's your mother.
She's here in the room with us.
She's trying to speak to you.
What does she say?
She wants to tell you about your sister...
- Where she is.
What is she saying?
Harold?
I don't know. I...
-  She's gone. - Come on, Harold.
I lost her.
- That's crap. You're full of crap. - No.
- Get out of here. - I'm telling you...
- She had a message. - Please go.
Look!
Who wrote that?
You did.
- Mulder. -  Mulder, it's me.
I found something, and I'm standing here not quite believing what it is.
- What is it? - I don't know if you know this,
In 1973. I know all about that.
A document that matches one that I found in the treasury investigation file.
But she had the original, Mulder.
I don't see where you're goin' with this, Scully.
And it's signed with the initials "C.G.B.S."
C.G.B. Spender...
the Smoking Man.
He was involved with this back in '73.
That's not exactly a revelation, Scully. He was a friend of my father's.
Mulder, you told me you believed that he's the man that killed your father,
that he's the man who's done nothing but confound your work,
who's come close to killing you.
And here he's ordering people to stop looking for your sister.
- You don't wanna press him? - It's a dead end.
He's never been of any help, and he's not gonna be of any help now.
Look, I'm pursuing this my own way, all right. I gotta go.
It's not exactly the end of the rainbow, is it, Harold?
There's something here. I'm getting a strong sense of it.
I think we should have a look.
I've had a look.
What are you afraid of? That you'll really find her?
- That you'd have to deal with it? - There's nothing here.
- It's a decommissioned base. - You wrote the name down yourself.
Why do you care so much about what I feel? Why is this so important to you?
You gentlemen need to move along.
I have to ask you to turn around and get back in your car.
There's nothing to see here.
There is something here to see, Agent Mulder. I'm sure of it.
- Hello?
I should have grabbed it for you.
I like to make myself useful.
You can start by putting out that cigarette.
You've got it all figured out, don't you, Agent Scully?
All but why you can't just come to the door and knock.
I did that.
No one answered.
You're sick.
I had an operation.
What do you want?
I want you to stop looking.
You've wanted that since 1973...
when you ordered an end to the search for Agent Mulder's sister.
Your initials are on that document.
Yes, I signed that order,
because I knew then what I know now... no one's gonna find her.
- Why not? - Because I believe she's dead.
No reason to believe otherwise.
You're a liar.
There was so much to protect before. It's all gone now.
So you just let Mulder believe that she was alive for all these years?
Out of kindness, Agent Scully.
Allow him his ignorance.
It's what gives him hope.
- My sister was here? - Yes.
One of these houses? Where?
I've lost it, whatever it was.
Which house, Harold? Come on. Which house?
Let's go, Harold.
You were right. This was the house.
- How do you know? - Look.
I told you! What did I tell you?
You told me she was here.
You didn't say with who.
When did you come up with this story, Mulder?
After her abduction, she was returned to him...
and he raised her at the military base, along with his son Jeffrey Spender.
- Mulder... - Scully, I saw her name in the cement.
Her handprints right next to his.
Mulder, I spoke to him...
the Smoking Man, C.G.B. Spender, whatever his name is.
You went to him?
He told me that she was dead.
Well, he's a liar.
Mulder, why would he lie now? I mean, think about it.
It hurts me to tell you this.
The handprints prove he's a liar! I saw her handprints in the cement.
Her name "Samantha" right underneath them. How more obvious can it be?
Harold Piller led me there. He led me right to 'em.
Oh, he led you, Mulder.
He led you from the moment that he met you.
- Something wrong?
Sit down, Harold.
Hi.
You're back.
- What? - That you're currently the subject...
of a criminal investigation into the murder of your son.
My son was taken from me. The police need someone to blame.
That's not all, Harold. Your history of mental illness.
You wouldn't have believed me if I had told you any of that.
- Look what I've shown you. - You only tell me what you see.
I came to you because I wanna help.
You think I'm a fraud? What do I have to gain from this?
How am I any different from you?
All I want is to find my son. I... I just...
I just want my little boy back.
I see these things. I don't know how, but... there has got to be a reason.
And if it's not to help, what is it?
I know your sister is out there.
Maybe I can prove it to you.
Whoever's lived here hasn't lived here in a long time.
- We're gonna need to hold hands. - What do you mean?
I'm going to try and summon their presence into the house.
Oh, yea. A seance. I haven't done that since high school.
Maybe afterwards we can play "postman" and "spin the bottle."
I'm not going to say anything.
I'm just going to be very quiet and still. That's how it seems to work best.
Um, you might experience a sudden chill...
or feel a pressure in your ears.
That means they're here.
And if they need to, they'll let themselves be seen.
Close your eyes...
and let them come to you.
They will come to you if you're ready to see.
- How will we know? - Shh.
Stay quiet. You'll know.
Mulder?
- What are you doing? - It's here.
What is?
There was a boy. He led me into this room.
Mulder?
It's a diary.
It's your sister's.
"They did more tests today, but not the horrible kind.
"I was awake and they made me lay still...
"while they shine lights in my eyes.
"They asked me questions, but I always lie now...
"and tell them what they wanna hear just to make 'em stop.
"I hate them and I hate the way they treat me,
They know I hate them, but they... don't even care."
This is 1979.
She's 14 years old here.
Fourteen years old.
"I remember faces. I think I had a brother...
"with brown hair who used to tease me.
"I hope...
someday he reads this and knows I wish I could see his face for real."
And then, uh,
she's, uh, talking about running away.
She wants to run away...
so that they stop doing the tests.
And then it just stops.
Let's get out of here.
You know, I never stop to think...
that the light is billions of years old by the time we see it.
From the beginning of time...
right past us into the future.
Nothing is ancient in the universe.
Maybe they are souls, Scully...
travel through time and starlight...
Iooking for homes.
I wonder what my mother saw.
I wonder what she was trying to tell me.
Get some sleep.
All right.
I got it, Mulder. I couldn't believe it when I saw it.
It was like it was looking for me.
- Sergeant's blotter, 1979. - What are you talking about?
The description matches your sister.
- When did you find this? - Mulder, it's almost noon.
Maybe she went by another name.
She could have given them a name other than her own.
She didn't give a name at all.
Read this. It's a medical report.
Admittance notes say the E.R. nurses couldn't get her name out of her.
Neither could the cops.
Her medical examination is normal.
Her mental state...
it says here she was exhibiting signs of paranoia.
Evidence of probable self-inflicted abuse,
including small crescent-shaped scars on her knees, wrists and chest.
Those are from the tests, Scully.
That's her. She was here.
Fourteen years old in this hospital.
"Diagnosis of condition incomplete. Tests unavailable."
And he knew.
He lied. He knew she was alive.
And the only reason he's lying now is because she's still alive.
Mulder, wait.
I know. You don't want me to get my hopes up. I understand that.
That was 1979. It was 21 years ago.
We have an E.R. nurse who signed her in.
What's wrong?
I have this powerful feeling, and I can't explain it,
but that... this is the end of the road.
That I've been brought here to learn the truth.
Are you ready for it?
Do you want me to go talk to her myself?
Okay.
Oh. I thought that was the door.
- Arbutus Ray? - Yes.
Are you the same Arbutus Ray that worked as a nurse...
at the Dominic Savio Memorial Hospital in 1979?
Yes, I'm she.
I'd like to ask you about a patient you treated...
a 14-year-old girl.
I remember. Yes.
She was such a pretty young girl.
You couldn't forget someone like her, or how frightened she was.
Scared for her sweet life.
The deputy brought her in. She was shaking like a leaf.
Wouldn't let anyone touch her but me.
Then the strangest thing happened.
You had a vision of her... dead.
Like the parents of Amber Lynn LaPierre.
No one believed me.
Honestly, you're the first person who...
- So you saw her dead? - That night in her bed.
I blinked and it was gone.
She was sleeping as sound as could be.
I don't know why, but...
it made some kind of strange sense.
What do you mean?
There were men.
They came to pick her up late that night.
I assumed the one was her father, but he...
he gave me such a chill when he looked at me...
when I asked him would he please put out his cigarette.
So, they took her?
They meant to.
But when I took them to her room,
she was gone.
Disappeared out of a locked room.
Just vanished.
Samantha.
Mulder, where'd you go?
End of the road.
He's okay. It's okay.
My son? You saw my son?
He's dead. They're all dead, Harold...
your son, Amber Lynn, my sister.
- No. - Harold.
You see so much, but you refuse to see him.
You refuse to let him go.
But you have to let him go now, Harold.
He's protected. He's in a better place. They're all in a better place.
We both have to let go, Harold.
You're wrong. I'm going to find him.
I don't believe you!
Mulder, what happened?
Are you sure you're all right?
I'm fine.
I'm free.

We've exhausted all medical and scientific evidence.
The brute fact is he's experiencing so much activity in his temporal lobe...
that it is effectively destroying his brain.
Enough!
There's only so much bluntness a mother can take.
- Sorry. I just... - All you do is sedate him.
You're turning him...
into a zombie.
I know you can hear me, Fox.
- Can you give me a sign? -  I can hear you, Mom.
Fox?
Mom, I can hear you.
I'm here.
I love you, my darling boy.
Mom, where you going?
Mom? Mom?
Come back, Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
When in disgrace with fortune in men's eyes.
Ah, but your mommy will still love you.
All a mother wants is to...
shield her boy from pain and danger.
Safe in the world as he was once in the womb.
But maybe we think a father demands more than mere survival.
Maybe we're afraid a father demands worldly adulation.
Success, heroism.
I know you can hear me.
I can always hear you.
Even when my mind is jammed with a thousand voices,
I can hear you like a snake hissing underneath.
How the hell did you get in here?
How does anything I do surprise you now?
Aren't you expecting me to sprout vampire fangs?
You've come to kill me.
It'd be better than living like a zombie, wouldn't it?
I'm giving you a choice.
- What choice? - Life or death.
Your account is squared with me, with God,
with the I.R.S., with the F.B.I.
Rise out of your bed and come with me.
I'm dying, you idiot.
If I could get up, I'd kick your ass.
Don't be so dramatic. Only part of you is dying...
the part that played the hero.
You suffered enough...
for the X-Files, for your partner,
for the world.
You're not Christ.
You're not Prince Hamlet.
You're not even Ralph Nader.
You can walk out of this hospital and the world will forget you.
Arise.
What... What the hell are you doing to me?
I'm showing you how to take the road not taken.
Take my hand.
- Why should I take your hand? - You can't read my mind?
No. I can't.
- All the voices are gone. - Take my hand, Fox.
You have to take the first step.
Take my hand.
I'm your father.
Sleep is a luxury, Agent Scully. A self-indulgence we have no time for.
- Nor does Agent Mulder. - How did you get in here?
Getting in is easy.
It's what you do once you're inside that's key.
- I need you to use it wisely. - Like you?
It's what Agent Mulder wanted. He knows what's wrong.
What he wants now is to prove it. It's why he asked for me, not you.
I don't believe that.
Two years ago your partner was infected with a virus he claimed was alien.
A virus reactivated in him by exposure to a source of energy, also alien.
Agent Mulder is living proof of what he tried so long to substantiate...
the existence of alien life.
But whatever it is, it's killing him.
And we have to get it out of him.
You destroy this and I'll destroy you.
- What happened? - Mulder's gone. He's disappeared.
- I know, I know. - How did this happen?
- His mother checked him out. - His mother?
- That's what they're saying. - Has anybody spoken with her?
Sir, this isn't just a case. This is Agent Mulder we're speaking about.
And I'm trying to help him...
by staying out of this from now on.
Sir?
I'm in a compromised position.
The less I know about Agent Mulder's whereabouts and yours,
the better.
The child is father to the man.
You've been asleep quite a while.
I suspect it'll be sometime before your sleep patterns return to normal.
Would you like an explanation?
I'm not sure.
- Why? - At some point I realized that...
if the Syndicate didn't kill you, the F.B.I. would.
If the F.B.I. didn't kill you, your own misguided heroism would.
There's really no way out for you.
There's no way for you to cheat death except by disappearing.
A man can't just disappear.
Oh, we've made entire cultures disappear.
Like me now, you'll become a man without a name.
But even while you miss your former identity,
you'll learn to love life's simpler pleasures.
Well, that'll be kind of tough with these on.
When you no longer wanna run, those will come off.
How do you feel?
I feel better than I did.
I gotta tell Scully. I gotta tell her.
If you do have contact with her, you'll put her in danger.
You're entering a kind of...
witness protection program for want of a better term.
- Can I offer you a cigarette? - I don't smoke.
Well, maybe now you do.
Don't move.
- Who's there? -  I don't mean to frighten you.
Albert Hosteen.
What are you doing here? How did you get here?
- I'm sorry to surprise you. - Surprise?
That you're standing here...
Last time I saw you was in New Mexico.
They'd taken you from the hospital. Your doctors feared the worst.
- I was hoping to see your partner. - He's missing.
You must save him.
He's very ill.
You must find him before something happens.
Not only for his sake,
for the sake of us all.
- Where are we? - Home.
This is your new life.
I don't understand.
You can drive away right now.
Drive back to Scully and your X-Files and imminent death.
I wouldn't be surprised if you did.
But I think you should take a look around.
Mulder was taken out of the hospital just before 2:00 a.m.
She checked him out A.M. A... against medical advice.
It's all legitimate until you go to surveillance.
This is a camera in the hall outside Mulder's room.
Here's inside his room.
And two other cameras on the ward.
We're guestimating there were at least three others involved.
Check this out.
Where's Waldo?
She's talking to someone.
Yeah.
I know who that is.
Hello?
Anybody home?
They can change your name,
but they can't change the things you love.
It can't be.
- You're dead. -  No.
No, just really relaxed.
Scully... saw you get shot...
on the bridge six years ago.
I was sure you were... dead.
One, uh, well-placed bullet.
A punctuation mark on a man's life and you get to start a whole new chapter.
I'm fine, son,
aside from a little tennis elbow.
I felt responsible for your death.
You can let that go. Clearly I'm alive.
I thought that you died for my quest.
Yes, along with Scully's sister and the man you thought was your father...
and Duane Barry and-and even Scully's mysterious illness...
and on and on and on.
You can let go of all that guilt.
I'm here to tell you that you're not the hub of the universe...
the cause of life and death.
We, you and I,
are merely puppets in a master plan... no more, no less.
You've suffered enough.
Now you should enjoy your life.
Let me show you something.
That's my wife and daughters.
We live just down the street.
I hope you visit us for dinner.
Oh. Oh, hey, buddy. That's okay.
You can build it again. Just start again.
Okay?
Who's there?
- Who are you? - Hundreds of little joys...
to open a door and have a woman beckon you in.
To have her make a fire and lay the table for you.
And when it's late,
to feel her take you into her arms.
This is Tina Mulder. I'm not in to take your call.
- Please leave your message.
This is Dana Scully.
Thank you. As before, you can reach me at your son's office at the F.B.I.
Thank you.
- Skinner.
Sir, did you send me this book?
- Excuse me? - This book?
It explains everything that I found in Africa,
using the same symbols that I found on the ship.
Agent Scully, I asked you not to involve me in this.
It's all here, sir. A foretelling of mass extinction.
A myth about a man who can save us from it. That's why they took Mulder.
They think that his illness is a gift...
a protection against a coming plague.
I'm sorry, Agent Scully. The assistant director has given me express orders...
- Not to let you in.
Sir, are you hurt?
Are you cut? Get on the phone.
Hey!
Stop that man!
Good morning.
- What's wrong, Fox?
There's nothing wrong. Perfect.
It's all perfect. What the hell am I doing here?
- You just need some coffee. - No, I'm... I'm serious.
I have commitments to the X-Files, to Scully, to my sister.
You think you know what that means... commitment.
- It's all just childish, Fox. - Childish?
Yes. You've been a child...
with only the responsibility of a child,
to your own dreams and fantasies.
and become a father.
Wow.
Diana, you... you lay all this on me after I sleep with you one time.
What's it gonna be like tomorrow?
- You have to let go, Fox. - Just like that?
I have every reason to believe left here to carry on his dirty work?
Hey. He lives the next block over.
We'll go visit after breakfast.
You told someone, didn't you? You let the information out.
- What are you talking about? - A man attacked Skinner in his office.
- For what? - For what he knows about Mulder.
I haven't told anyone.
What is this?
These are mine!
You've hacked into my files. What are you doing with these?
- I was having them analyzed. - By whom?
- The National Institute of Health. - What?
where did you get it?
This was not supposed to go public.
- Wherever you got it,
that data supports what's happened to Mulder.
It proves what he's become... biologically alien.
- What are you hiding? - It doesn't matter.
It matters to someone.
Whoever it is, it sounds like they're looking for Mulder too.
I wasn't expecting you so soon.
I thought you'd take a few days to settle in.
Including why you live in a bigger house than I do.
I've got quite a few mouths to feed.
Three grandkids...
and, uh, your sister.
She's been living here all along.
Living a life you'd forsaken.
He said you were coming.
A father has high hopes for his son.
The depth of his capacity for suffering.
Like father, like son.
They think what he has is killing him,
but in actuality, he's never been more alive.
- Do you think he dreams? - Oh, I'm sure he dreams.
a simpler life...
full of small pleasures.
Extraordinary men are always most tempted by the most ordinary things.
Dreams are all he has now.
- Bum a cigarette, Agent Fowley? - I don't smoke.
Really? I could swear I smell cigarette smoke on you.
- Let's cut the crap, shall we? - Yes. Let's.
Where's Mulder?
you could think about what you could have done to prevent it.
I just want you to think...
think of Mulder when you met him,
think of the promise and the life in front of him.
Think of him now.
And then try and stand there in front of me, look me in the eye...
and tell me Mulder wouldn't bust his ass trying to save you.
I'm thinking, Agent Scully.
I'm always thinking.
It's a chance none of us ever expected,
let alone hope for.
After all these years, trying to develop a compatible alien human hybrid,
to have one ready-made.
All these years, all the questioning why.
There was no way you could have predicted this.
The fact remains, he's become our savior.
He's immune to the coming viral apocalypse. He's the hero here.
He may not survive the procedure.
Then he suffers a hero's fate.
Diana?
Fox.
It's time, honey.
How you doin'?
Don't think of the man.
Think of the sacrifice he's making for all of us... for the world.
It would have been nice to give him a choice.
You don't think Mulder would have chosen this?
To become the thing he sought for so long?
To feel what it's like?
He is what he sought.
We'll never know.
Besides, his task is almost complete.
I'll carry the burden from here on in.
I know about the boy.
The boy on the beach.
The vision you go to in your mind.
We all have such places...
a point of memory and desire.
I've seen him thousands of times.
I've never seen what he wants me to see.
Close your eyes.
He's ready to show you, if you're ready to see.
Wow! What did you make?
An unidentified flying object.
Hey, what are you doing? Why are you destroying your spaceship?
It's your spaceship. You're destroying it.
You were supposed to help me.
- You're running out of time.
Why do you come to me like this?
Why, when I can't find him?
You don't look in the right place.
- I don't think you're hearing me. - You don't know where he is?
Have you looked for him...
here?
Are you asking me to pray?
There are more worlds than the one you can hold in your hand.
I hope you see the poetry in this, Diana.
You're removing genetic material that may kill your son.
We're forcing the next step in evolution to save man.
We're doing God's work, Diana.
Without this immunity, everyone would die.
This knowledge is God's blessing.
I'll carry on for Mulder from here.
The patient's come out. Mulder's awake.
-  Is he feeling any pain? -  Flat on the monitor.
Let's do this thing.
Rest now.
Can you open the blind?
I'd like to take a look outside.
I wanted you to have peace.
Where's Samantha?
Your sister died five years ago.
What about Deep Throat?
We've been over this. He's dead.
Diana's dead.
And Scully.
Scully's dead?
She's dead.
It's time for you to let go.
They're waiting for you, if you let go.
Close your eyes, Fox.
We're the last, you and I.
The end...
and the beginning.
There's nothing to be done.
Nothing at all.
Scully. I knew you'd come.
They told me you were dead.
And you believed them?
- Traitor. - What?
- Deserter. Coward. - Scully, don't.
What do you mean?
Not in a comfortable bed with the devil outside.
No, you don't understand. He's taken care of me.
No, Mulder.
He's lulled you to sleep.
He's made you trade your true mission for creature comforts.
There was no mission.
- There were no aliens. - No aliens?
Have you looked outside, Mulder?
I can't.
I'm... too tired.
No, Mulder. You must get up.
You must get up and fight.
Especially you.
This isn't your place.
Get up, Mulder.
Get up and fight the fight.
- Scully?
Scully?
Scully?
Scully?
Mulder?
Mulder, you've got to wake up.
I've got to get you out of here.
- Mulder, can you understand me?
Mulder, you've got to get up.
I don't know how much time we have.
- You've got to get up, Mulder.
No one can do it but you, Mulder.
Mulder, help me.
Please, Mulder.
You... help me.
but I couldn't find a tie to go with my victory cap.
Mulder, no work. You have to go back to bed.
Oh, wait. Tie goes to the runner.
Scully, I, uh...
I was comin' down to work to tell you...
that Albert Hosteen is dead.
He died last night in New Mexico.
He was there. We... We prayed together.
Mulder, I don't believe that. I... I don't believe it. It's impossible.
Is it any more impossible than what you saw in Africa or what you saw in me?
I don't know what to believe anymore.
Mulder, I was so determined to find a cure to save you...
that I could deny what it was that I saw.
And now I don't even know. I don't know...
I don't know what the truth is, I don't know who to listen to,
I don't know who to trust.
Diana Fowley was found murdered this morning.
I never trusted her.
But she helped save your life just as much as I did.
She gave me that book.
It was her key that led me to you.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I know she was your friend.
Scully, I was like you once. I didn't know who to trust and I...
I chose another path,
another life, another fate where I found my sister.
And even though my world was unrecognizable and upside down,
there was one thing that remained the same.
You were my friend...
and you told me the truth.
Even when the world was falling apart, you were my constant,
my touchstone.
And you are mine.
Ah!

AJell-O salad with little pear chunks.
It's the Wednesday special at the hospital cafeteria. I can't escape it.
Listen to you. That didn't stop you from eating my dessert.
Well, all right. The profiteroles weren't bad.
- You didn't want me to starve, did you?
He ate mine too.
Daddy, why don't you take this before my arm falls off.
Thanks, honey.
Everybody?
- One last shot. - Oh, Dad.
Do you think we can draw the line at 600 photographs?
Six hundred and one.
Quit griping. And hold up that eyesore, Robert.
God knows when you're gonna win another one.
Irv, you wanna think about staying the night?
What? I get to stay at the home of the Bay Area Doctor of the Year?
It's a deal.
Proud of you, Robert.
Up. Hold it up. Say "cheese."
"Presented to Dr. Robert Wieder M. D...
"for the great wisdom, skill and compassion...
he exhibits in the practice of medicine."
It's gonna look awfully nice in your office.
What are you thinking?
How this is just the cherry on top.
How lucky I am.
- What is it? - Downstairs motion sensor.
You think Dad tripped the alarm?
The alarm hasn't been tripped.
You got me. I'll go check it out.
Irv?
Irving, is everything all right?
What do you think, Scully? Is this a name, possibly,
or a code or an anagram?
T-H-E-E-F.
I assume it's supposed to be T-H-I-E-F. Thief.
Insert your own Dan Quayle joke here.
Lousy spelling aside, what do you think it refers to? Who's the thief?
Well, that's certainly one question.
I've got many.
"Mulder, why are we here?"
Mmm, to be fair, I might have used the words,
"Mulder, how is this an X-File?"
You see that, Scully? You always keep me guessing.
This is Dr. Irving Thalbro, age 66, found hanged with his throat cut,
his family tucked away and in bed not 40 feet from here.
Didn't see or hear anything.
Which would certainly shine the light of suspicion on them.
Except they're the ones that called it in,
and there's no evidence whatsoever to link them to the crime.
Which is why the police are rightly wondering...
if Dr. Thalbro killed himself.
Except who, then, did this?
Blood pattern doesn't indicate that the good doctor did it,
who I am assuming could read and write above a fourth grade level.
I'll admit, Mulder, this is not an open-and-shut case.
But, uh, it doesn't make it an X-File.
Well, there is one detail that does.
This.
Dirt?
Dirt. It's a very powerful component of hexcraft,
as well as the pattern in which it was originally arranged.
Check this out.
- Looks like a human form.
Hexcraft, as in putting a curse on someone?
Murdering them magically?
That's what it looks like to me. Now, I know what you're gonna say, Scully.
No, hexcraft. I mean, I'll buy that as the intent here.
It certainly jives with the evidence.
I say we talk to the family.
I'll always keep you guessing.
It was probably the greatest night of my life.
Till...
Sir, can you think of any enemies your father-in-law might have made?
Maybe inadvertently through his medical practice...
or a business dealing, perhaps?
Everybody loved Irving.
Everyone who knew him. He was...
No, I can't conceive of it.
Dr. Wieder, do you have any enemies?
I'm sorry I have to ask. There was a message left behind.
If it doesn't refer to your father-in-law, it may refer to you.
Thief?
Are you asking if my dad's a thief?
He saves people's lives. He's a good man.
Honey.
If I have any enemies, I don't know them.
At the home of his son-in-law, Dr. Robert Wieder,
Dr. Irving Thalbro was found hanged at 1:48 this morning.
The details are sketchy. It's my understanding...
that police are treating the case as a murder.
This is due in part to core evidence left at the scene.
Hello? Mr. Peattie?
Mr. Peattie, I know you're in there.
Are you cooking?
You aren't supposed to be cooking.
You aren't supposed to be cooking.
That smell like somethin' you wanna eat?
- Well, what is it, then? - Medicine.
Oh, all right. Uh,
just so long as you're not cooking.
Seems like you could use yourself a poultice for your back.
Old Peattie fix ya right up.
Be ready later.
pronounced spikes of methane and sulfur compounds.
The signature of decay.
It's graveyard dirt, also known as conjure dust.
It's one of the most powerful hexing elements, whether for good or evil.
Not the kind of stuff you want to be on the wrong end of.
Uh-huh.
Well, go ahead, Scully. Keep me guessing.
Kuru.
The-The, uh...
The disease that New Guinea tribesmen get?
From eating the brains of their relatives.
I thought my grandpa slurping his soup was bad.
Practically speaking, Mulder, Kuru doesn't even exist anymore,
not in New Guinea and certainly not in the U.S.
But this man's cerebellum and his triadim...
clearly show signs of it, Mulder.
I mean, these plaques... his brain is riddled with them.
Kuru makes you crazy, right?
Yeah, stark-raving, among other things. But in this case,
stark-raving mad enough to slit his own throat and hang himself.
Mulder, that's what his autopsy shows...
from the wound pattern to-to the blood spray.
it was inflicted upon him.
The graveyard dirt, the hex.
He was given this disease so that he would kill himself.
Nan? Honey?
Robert?
Look at this.
It could be they needed it as evidence.
I'm telling you, I'm scared.
I can't stay here, Robert. I can't live in this house anymore.
Lucy can't, not after what's happened here.
And now this picture of us is missing.
- It'll turn up. - No. It doesn't make any sense.
Nothing that's happened here makes any sense.
It does. Nan,
listen to me.
Your dad was ill.
He had a kind of progressive dementia.
That's what the F.B.I. autopsy showed.
I reviewed their findings, and I have to agree.
Honey, we will get through this.
- Oh, my God! Nan, honey!
Oh, my God!
- Nan! - Dad?
Lucy, call 911.
Call 911!
Nan!
Dr. Wieder?
We understand you've made a diagnosis.
Diffuse Cutaneous Flesh Moniliasis. Old World type.
- I take it that's rare. - In San Francisco? It's unheard of.
Maybe in Central Africa.
- Well, the rarer, the better. - What do you mean by that?
Someone directed this to happen to your wife...
just as someone directed what happened to your father-in-law.
My enemy you were talking about... the one who thinks I'm a thief?
Agent, you're a doctor. Explain to your partner...
that no one can direct a person to get sick.
The dirt you found in your bed drawn in the shape of a body,
that's indicative of folk magic.
That's what I believe is being used against you.
Folk magic?
You mean, like, Babayaga? Gypsies?
I was actually thinking less Eastern and more Celtic.
Maybe Scots-Irish or Appalachian, even.
I'm supposed to take this seriously?
Sir, regardless of the particulars,
I think it's clear that there was an intruder in your home.
And I think it would be prudent for you...
to accept our protection...
and help us to identify this person.
Prudent for me would be to continue treating my wife.
If we don't stop who's causing this, your treatments won't matter.
So modern medicine and all it encompasses...
artificial hearts, laser surgery, gene therapy, to name a few...
all of that arrayed against a pile of magic dirt?
And you tell me I'll lose.
I have M.R.I. s to look at.
Oh, yeah, Mulder, win him over.
He will lose unless we can find a way to stop it.
What do you suggest?
A second opinion.
The truth always hurts, don't it, Doc?
Who are you?
Is this you? You did this?
What do you want from me?
Don't you be frettin' none about that.
I'm gettin' my nickel's worth.
You're doin' a fine job so far.
What the hell are you talking about? What is this all about?
Lynette Peattie.
And don't you be sayin' you don't recollect her.
Uh-uh. No, no, no.
Look, if I've done anything to upset you, I...
It's no use trying to intimidate me if I don't know how I've offended you!
Tell me!
What makes me a thief?
You be a smart man.
I figure...
you ponder it a while, it gonna come to ya.
Wait!
No. No matter how I spell it, there's no Lynette Peattie.
- She's not in my patient file. - She's not in any doctor's patient file.
No one by that name has ever been admitted to the hospital.
You think you treated her?
What aboutJane Does?
You treated three in the last two years.
Pull the files, please.
You remember old Boon. I know you do.
This mangy, old, ugly dog.
Smart.
People-smart, and then some.
Oh, he sure did love you.
He crawled up under that house...
the very day you left.
Wouldn't come out for nothin'.
Not no ham bone, nothin'.
He just knew that his life was over.
You stole his heart too.
You shouldn't oughta left.
You're there.
I... wanted to thank you.
That poultice worked a miracle on my back.
I was about to knock and...
and ask if I could get a little more.
Whatever that is, it sure is stinky.
Stinky's good.
Good afternoon.
Can I help you?
Yeah, we're looking for some alternative medical advice.
Well, you've come to the right place.
I get a lot of folks fed up with their H.M.O.s.
- Well, actually, we're not here for us. - Yeah.
Oh! Chief, back in your pocket.
It's dirt.
It's goofer dust is what it is.
I don't know what your intentions are with that.
- Goofer dust? - Conjure dust, goofer dust.
How would you go about making somebody sick using that?
We're investigating a murder. That's why I'm asking.
Oh.
Speaking strictly in the academic sense,
you'd spread it on or near your victim to direct misfortune.
So you could give them any illness you wanted...
that's a lot trickier.
It requires something special.
- A voodoo doll. - No. They're called "puppets."
Inside, you place three thorns of a blood red rose,
a strand of hair, and a photo of your victim.
Maybe other items as well. Depends on the operator.
Sew it up, say your spell.
How would you counteract one of these?
Depends on who you're dealing with.
But if the person you're looking for...
is powerful enough to bring about a murder, he's probably charmed.
Which would mean what?
It means just that.
He's drawing on the energy of a charm.
A source of magic power.
It could be any item,
provided that it's very important to him.
Something that holds great meaning for him.
And unless you can separate him from his charm,
you're out of luck.
Poppin' corn.
You gotta put the money in first.
Don't look like no poppin' corn to me.
Put it in the microwave. Then you get your popcorn.
Oh. Microwave.
I heard tell of such a thing. It's a true wonder.
Radiation.
Come from the heart of the atom.
I think it be God's own glow.
You're gonna be very happy, I promise.
The drug therapy I'm giving her is working wonders.
Come on. Come see.
- Mom. - Hi, sweetie.
- You look good. - Yeah, right.
But I am definitely feeling better.
This thing gives off about as much radiation as a dental X ray.
- Nothing to worry about. - I know.
It just scares me. Wish me luck?
Doctor!
Switch it off. Switch it off.
All done.
How could somebody orchestrate all of this?
You believe that your wife was murdered?
It was no accident. There was no malfunction of the machine.
Yes, I believe she was murdered.
And you still have no idea why?
The pathologist found this branded into your wife's chest.
Sir, we can't help you if you withhold information from us.
A man came to see me yesterday.
My age, older, maybe.
Tall.
He mentioned someone named Lynette Peattie.
I didn't know who she was at first.
Turns out she was a Jane Doe I treated last October.
She was in a bus rollover. Came in amid a wave of victims.
She was the worst off.
I could barely put fluids in fast enough to keep up with the blood loss.
We were rushing around triaging people.
Everybody knew she was dying.
It was only a matter of time.
She was in agony.
This was my course of treatment.
You gave her morphine.
Lots of it.
I pushed it myself.
She kept screaming,
and her heart rate kept climbing.
So...
I kept pushing.
I took maybe the last 20 minutes of her life.
It was a fair trade to make for the pain.
Her father doesn't agree.
What makes you think it's her father?
He thinks you robbed him of his family.
And that's why he's systematically robbing you of yours.
What am I supposed to do? My daughter Lucy...
You don't do anything. Let us find a way to protect you.
- How? - I have an idea where to start.
If Lynette Peattie was Carlos theJackal,
I would've had an easier time tracking her down.
There's no birth certificate, no social security number, nothing.
Better known to the world as Jane Doe, 6149.
Well, her name shows up once in the records...
of a Vista Inoculation Program in 1981.
That's when her father, one Oral Peattie,
refused to allow her to be inoculated against polio.
But there's no address for him. There's no record of him whatsoever.
Mulder, why are we exhuming this girl?
Well, I'm thinking of her dear old backwoods dad...
and where he gets all his graveyard dirt.
Here? His daughter's grave?
The occultist we spoke to said that the person...
casting these magic spells was charmed.
That he had a source of power that was very meaningful to him...
and he kept it close by.
Lynette Peattie's body?
That's my guess.
So as long as her body remains here resting in peace in the Bay Area,
he remains powerful.
But if we were to ship it off to Quantico...
Hold onto that.
Mr. Peattie?
Mr. Peattie, my pain's back.
I was wondering if I could get a little more of that poultice.
Mr. Peattie?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were home.
All right, thank you. They'll be there before dark.
We rented a cabin for you. It's important that you get out of town.
And you believe by our leaving it will somehow weaken him?
Well, what's important is that he believes that.
At any rate, if he can't find you, he can't hurt you.
How do you know he'll come forward?
Because he hasn't gotten everything he wants.
Our ownJohn Gillness is on the scene.
San Mateo County health officials admit they're at a loss...
to explain the sudden onset of the 56-year-old woman's bizarre illness,
but insist there is no cause for alarm.
- Pretty weird, huh? - There's been no official diagnosis.
Sources say they believe the woman contracted...
the rare but deadly Group 'A"Streptococcus...
We will keep a close watch on this story and any new developments.
Bathroom's clear!
Clear here!
- Scully. - Peattie may be on to us.
- What happened? - I found out where he lives,
only he's cleared out and he's taken his magic charm with him.
At least as much of it as he can carry.
My guess is he's looking for you.
I didn't see anybody following us.
Well, just keep an eye out, Scully. I'm on my way.
Okay.
Soon.
Very soon.
What was that?
Stay where you are.
Oh! Oh, God!
- Oh! - What is it?
I don't know.
I can't...
- I can't see!
- Agent Scully! - Just stay where you are.
Stay down.
- Oh, Doctor! - Leave him alone!
- Daddy! - Get back!
Get back!
Don't make me hurt you!
Can hurt the man that ain't got nothin'left.
You know who I be now?
Maybe you can recollect my daughter.
I remember! I never forgot!
I'm-I'm sorry for your loss,
but I did everything humanly possible to save her!
The arrogant little man.
I did everything I could!
And when I couldn't do anymore, I eased her suffering!
By killin' her.
If I be there,
I save her!
You weren't there!
Scary death in some field.
No name on her,
far away from her people.
It wouldn't be right.
So now, little man,
I gonna show you what be possible.
I'm gonna show you...
an eye for an eye.
You're not gonna hurt my daughter!
Daddy!
Baby.
- Daddy! Daddy!
Doctor? What's happening?
- Daddy!
Dr. Wieder!
- You're killing him!
Daddy!
Stop! Daddy!
- Daddy!
Daddy.
Lynette Peattie's body is on its way back home to O'Neal, West Virginia.
She's going back to her people after all.
You know, Mulder, I would have made the same call.
As a doctor,
if I was certain that I couldn't save her life...
and she was in that much pain,
- I would've done what Wieder did. - Mm-hmm.
It seems pretty clear cut.
Except maybe it's not.
You're wondering if maybe Peattie could've saved her life?
You do keep me guessing.

Holy Ghost, come to me.
Praise God. Praise God. Move up on me, Holy Ghost.
Praise God. This here sinner repents.
Holy Ghost, move up on me.
Protect me and mine with your quickening power.
Holy Ghost, come to me.
Aah!
Oh, help me, Jesus!
Oh, help me, Jesus! Help me, Jesus!
Not as far as you know.
Right.
Not this time of year.
All right. Thank you, Doctor. Good-bye.
Snakes.
Lots and lots of snakes.
Very pissed-off ones, from the look of it.
It's the former Mr. Jared Chirp of McMinn County, Tennessee.
- Oh, my God. - 116 separate bite marks.
Judging from the wound measurements,
there were 50 different snakes involved, mostly copperheads and rattlers.
But it says here that he was found dead in his car.
Yeah, with a pistol in his hand. He fired six shots into the floorboards,
into the passenger seat, even into his own right kneecap.
The windows were shut and the doors were locked.
But what happened to all the snakes?
No one seems to know that. There was not a scale found.
especially because these rattlesnakes tend to hibernate in winter.
So you think that Mr. Chirp was murdered.
It certainly would appear that way, but the question is how.
There's no physical evidence at all... no tire tracks, no footprints.
Why would anybody use poisonous snakes as a murder weapon?
Maybe it's symbolic. I mean, serpents and religion have gone hand in hand.
They've represented the temptation of Eve, original sin.
They've been feared and hated throughout history,
as they've been thought to embody Satan... to serve evil itself.
Maybe these ones actually do.
These particular serpents actually were serving evil?
Are you gonna type that on our travel request?
No.
But at the very least this case does seem to center around religion,
and you're not the only one to think that, by the way.
Jared is in a better place now, Gracie.
He's at peace.
You know Reverend Mackey's right, honey.
He is in a better place.
Reverend Samuel Mackey?
My name is Fox Mulder. This is Dana Scully.
We're with the F.B.I. May we speak with you, sir?
Come on, Gracie. Let's get you home.
I've already spoken to the sheriff about it,
though I'm not sure that that was a good idea.
Specifically, you had suspicions about the manner in which he died?
I should be the last one to point a finger or say a harsh word.
Our church is founded on acceptance and tolerance...
- Of all people, all beliefs. - But?
the Church of God with Signs & Wonders.
It practices snake handling.
As a sign of faith, worshippers handle deadly snakes or drink poison.
They believe that the Holy Spirit protects the righteous.
Jared grew up in that church, but it is very difficult...
to walk away from a belief system that one is raised in.
It takes great courage.
Why did he walk away?
He and Gracie, his girlfriend, left it together.
They found that a rigid interpretation of the Bible was not for them,
especially when it involves risking life and limb in the act of worship.
But, again, it is not for me to judge.
I will say, however, that both Jared and Gracie...
were persecuted by the members of their former church.
All this animus...
stems from their church leader, Enoch O'Connor.
Animus enough to motivate a murder?
Snake handling. We didn't learn that in catechism class.
That's funny, I knew a couple Catholic schoolgirls who were expert at it.
Enoch O'Connor?
Federal agents.
Where's the light switch?
The nearest one? Probably ten miles from here.
Yeah.
All right.
Rattlesnakes and medieval visions of damnation.
I, for one, feel a whole lot closer to God.
I don't know, Scully. When you get right down to it,
is snake handling any harder to buy into than...
communion wafers or transubstantiation...
Or believing in flying saucers, for that matter.
I'm just saying that your faith and O'Connor's seem...
to be based on the same book.
Uh-oh, Scully. What do you think O'Connor keeps in here?
Something slithery?
- It's all right. It's empty. - Why is it empty?
By what right are you here?
Reverend Enoch O'Connor, we're federal agents.
We're, uh, with the F.B.I.
Reverend, do something about these snakes, please.
You got nothing to fear if you're righteous people.
Just in case we're not, we could use a little righteous help here.
What do you want?
That boy strayed from the path and was lost to the Dark One.
I'm sorry for his soul.
- There ain't much else to say. - He died from multiple snake bites.
We thought maybe you'd have a special insight into that.
I do.
- It was a test. - Test? What do you mean?
A test of faith. A test of righteousness.
When the devil aims to test you, you best be ready.
And you sure better know which side you're on.
You speaking about the devil's test or your test?
I don't think you people realize which side you're on.
I do.
You can leave now.
Tennessee. Snakes.
Thank you, Mulder. Thank you so much.
I say we arrest him and catch the first flight out of here.
Apparently, he was in Kentucky the nightJared Chirp died.
Mulder, there are other people in his congregation.
Jared Chirp died with a packed suitcase by his side.
There's gotta be somebody that knows where he was headed.
Here you go, honey.
Reverend Mackey?
Jared called the boardinghouse late the night he died.
He wanted to talk to Gracie.
I didn't let him. It was after 2:00.
She was sound asleep, and it sounded to me like the boy had been drinkin'.
He just wasn't makin' any sense.
He was rantin' about seein' the devil and payin' for his sins.
Iris, why didn't you tell the police?
I don't know how to tell Gracie.
I kept her from speaking toJared his last night on earth.
I couldn't have known though.
- I couldn't have. - No, you couldn't have known.
I can help you talk to Gracie.
- Reverend Mackey? Everybody's here. - Thank you, Gracie.
You and I will see this through, Iris, right after study group.
Thank you.
-  Our God is a fearsome God. -  Amen!
He demands our very lives!
"'Tis better to be hot or cold than lukewarm."
God says if you're lukewarm...
he will vomit you out of his mouth!
Yes!
- Did you hear what I said? - Praise God. Praise God.
Yes. God hates the lukewarm!
"'So, because you are lukewarm...
I am about to spit you out of my mouth."'
Now, that could sound pretty harsh, couldn't it?
I mean, depending on how one reads it.
But if we put this verse in a historical context,
I think we'll see thatJohn was specifically addressing...
the problems of the church of Laodicea.
God wants you hot!
God wants you on fire!
PraiseJesus!
God wants you to put your money...
where your mouth is!
People ask me why I handle snakes.
- Hallelujah! I tell 'em...
it's 'cause the scripture tells me to!
Praise God!
He offers to join us,
to come into our lives and dine with us...
if only we'd open the door.
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
The manner in which John ends this chapter,
his emphasis is on teaching the church of Laodicea perseverance.
He uses the word "overcome" not once, but twice.
Good Lord, come save me I'm comin'to the light
Good Lord, come save me I'm comin' to the light
Good Lord, come save me I'm comin' to the light
Sing songs of praise to the Lord
Good Lord, I love you I know that you're the light
- Witness the awesome power...
of God as he blesses his people...
and destroys his enemies.
Thank you, God!
I don't understand it. None of us saw or heard anything.
Just her scream. When we ran in, she was lying on the floor.
I cleared everybody out of the building once I saw the bite marks, but...
Reverend, how close was Iris toJared Chirp?
Not particularly close,
but I'd spoken with her not 15 minutes earlier about him.
- What'd you talk about? - She was upset.
Something aboutJared calling her the night he died, looking for Gracie.
Something about him paying...
for his sins.
But I don't know. We didn't get to finish our conversation.
Maybe that was the point.
Why Iris? Why is this happening?
Gracie, we're investigating the leader of your former church, Enoch O'Connor.
We believe he may have had something to do with what happened here tonight.
We would appreciate anything you could tell us about him.
No, he didn't do this.
He didn't do this.
This is Satan's work, not man's.
Gracie, that sounds like something Reverend O'Connor might say.
Now, you're not a member of that congregation anymore.
I understand this, because you're someone who thinks for herself.
No! Don't you think I would know?
Me, of all people?
He couldn't have done this. He just couldn't.
-  Gracie might be biased. - O'Connor is your father.
When Gracie got pregnant...
O'Connor barred her from his church... she and Jared Chirp.
His church and his home.
- You comin'? - I think I'll check around back.
"Pray for the souls... lost to us. "
Oh!
You must be judged!
Repent!
Pray for the Lord's quickening power.
To the hands of God.
Let her go!
Your F.B.I. partner could've learned something about herself...
if you hadn't have stopped me.
Some powerful good news, maybe.
I'd say it's good news for you that she's not here right now,
considering what you tried to do to her.
Is that what you did to your wife?
Alice O'Connor.
Succumbed to multiple snake bites inJune 1994.
It happened during a church service...
or at least, that's what you told local police.
You got away with it...
almost.
What was, uh, the problem with your wife?
Was she not... righteous enough for you?
Just like your daughter's boyfriend... or Iris Finster?
Educated man. Too smart to know any better.
Smart enough to know you're a murderer.
Satan is near, and you don't even have eyes.
You're just proud and fancy free.
Man, no one quite passes muster with you, huh?
You feel the need to exact some kind of Old Testament revenge?
What about your daughter? What were your plans for her?
I pray for her soul.
I pray and I pray, because she's lost.
Because she no longer believes as you do?
You think because you're educated, you're better than most? You ain't.
Unless you're smart down here...
the devil's gonna make a fool of you, and you ain't even gonna know it.
I changed my mind. I don't want to see him.
Besides, I won't do any better than you people at getting him to talk.
Gracie.
You still don't believe your father did it?
It don't matter what I believe.
He'll be judged as he deserves.
Can't nobody avoid it.
Help me, Jesus.
Deputy found him about an hour ago.
There's no telling when he was attacked.
I guess it's looking less and less like he's a suspect.
Unless he somehow managed to do this to himself...
as a test of his own righteousness.
Well, if so, Mulder, the jury's still out. I just spoke to his doctors.
- He's not receiving it. - Why not?
Gracie stepped in. She's trying to forbid treatment on religious grounds.
It's not clear whether she has a legal claim to do it, but she says that...
it's up to God as to whether he lives or dies.
And you're thinking that her actions may not be entirely motivated...
by concern for her father's eternal soul?
Well, more to the point, Mulder, what if she did this?
She told me that her father would be judged as he deserves.
- You think this is what she meant? - She grew up around snakes.
Who's to say she isn't every bit as adept at handling them as he is?
I can see her being angry enough at her father to attack him,
but what about the others?
He left in a hurry. Packed one suitcase and a gun.
Earlier that night he calls Gracie,
gets Iris instead and starts rambling about paying for his sins.
He's frightened and wants to leave town,
presumably with Gracie.
So what's he scared of?
I don't understand how O'Connor's church...
exerts a strong pull on these people.
- It's not so hard to understand.
It's a culture with a very well-defined set of rules.
- It's an intolerant culture, Mulder. - I don't know, Scully.
Sometimes a little intolerance can be a welcome thing.
Clear-cut right and wrong, black and white, no shades of gray.
In a society where hard and fast rules are harder and harder to come by,
Fox Mulder, would welcome someone telling you what to believe?
I'm just saying that somebody offering you all the answers...
can be a very powerful thing.
Oh, it's lab results.
Am I reading this right? DidJared Chirp have himself tested for sterility?
Which turns out to be more or less the case.
Based on this, that means Jared can't be the father of Gracie's baby.
It's dated the day he died.
So maybe he was killed because he discovered the truth.
Gracie...
I'd like to ask you to reconsider.
No. This is what he'd want.
He may die without medical treatment.
I've seen him bit a dozen times.
He always said that it was up to God...
whether he lives or dies.
Said it was a worse sin not to trust God.
There are many ways to trust God, Gracie.
One of them is to trust in the miracles of doctors and medicine.
Or in your heart...
do you really not want him to get better?
It ain't for me.
I can't risk his soul.
When you first came to me,
you said that you wanted to think for yourself...
to live your life...
as you saw fit.
If you stand here and let your father die,
whose beliefs are you living?
Yours...
or his?
You're doing the right thing.
I'll go tell the doctor, okay?
Agents, Enoch O'Connor is gone.
I was away for five minutes. His bed's empty.
Gracie is gone too.
How could Gracie have possibly gotten him out of here?
- Maybe he took her. - He was on his deathbed.
That's impossible. And besides, what's his motivation?
I may be able to answer that.
Jared Chirp wasn't the father of Gracie's child.
We know that. What about it?
Enoch O'Connor is.
That's why she wanted to get away from him and his church...
as fast as she could.
And I tried to teach her to forgive him.
Uuh! Daddy, please!
I'm bringin' you home.
Somebody help me!
In the name of our holy and most fearsome God.
Hallelujah!
Resist the devil and he will flee.
Resist him!
Something's wrong. Something's wrong with my baby.
Oh!
DearJesus, put your hands on this woman. You can heal her.
Oh, yes, God. That's it.
Yes, Jesus. Yes, Jesus.
O Lord. Dear Lord.
DearJesus, deliver this woman.
Jesus. Jesus.
Yes, Lord. Yes, Jesus.
- No! Don't, don't! - Dear God.
Dear Heavenly Father, deliver this woman.
Lay your hands on this woman.
- God! Yes! - No!
- Don't! Don't! - Yes. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
DearJesus. DearJesus.
HolyJesus! Hallelujah!
DearJesus! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Hallelujah! DearJesus!
- How is she? - Deep shock and some loss of blood.
What happened here?
- Where's the baby? - These folks aren't talkin'.
Scully.
Take a look at this.
Snakes.
She gave birth to snakes?
The devil has been cast out.
Stay with her.
- Where are you going? - To find her father.
He's gonna wanna tie up some loose ends.
You stole what was most precious to me.
Gracie?
She came to me on her own.
- She wanted to escape a life of fear...
and judgment, of intolerance.
- Please, O God... - She fled a harsh and vengeful God...
and you.
Drop the knife!
Uuh!
You all right?
- Daddy?
- Daddy? - Gracie, it's Agent Scully.
We're taking you to the doctor right now, okay?
- No, I gotta... - Can you tell me what happened, Gracie?
Ohh!
Gracie, you're gonna be okay. He can't hurt you anymore.
You don't understand. He saved me.
I'll call for an ambulance.
Relax. Help's on the way.
No, it's not. I told you, boy,
you still don't know which side you're on.
Be smart. Down here.
Yes, please hurry. They're on their way.
- Agent. - It wasn't O'Connor.
It was you. You killed Jared Chirp.
- You're joking. - No. I'm just beginning to see it now.
Jared must've come to understand that he wasn't the father of Gracie's baby...
that you were.
Did he confront you earlier that night, only to see you for who you really are?
Just who is it you think I am?
Is that what happened with Iris Finster?
Was she beginning to catch on? Is that why you killed her?
Or was it just to further frame Enoch O'Connor?
Is that was this is really about? Ruining O'Connor? Seducing his daughter?
Destroying him by any conceivable means?
- Are you a righteous man, Agent Mulder? - Stay where you are.
It's just a simple question.
Most people believe they're on the side of angels.
But are they?
If you were put to the test, how would you do?
- Aah... aah!
Where's Mulder?
- Help! -  No!
You can't help him. This is his alone.
Mulder!
Aah!
- Mackey? - No, still no trace,
even though every law enforcement agency in Tennessee's out looking for him.
They won't find him.
People think the devil has horns and a tail.
He's just a man, Mulder...
- Just like O'Connor. - Not like O'Connor.
If this was some kind of test, looks like I failed.
I'd say if it was, you passed with flying colors.
- You're alive, aren't you? - Proud and fancy free.
Reverend Wells, it's a real joy to have a man in the pulpit...
who has such an open and modern way of looking at God.
Bless you for saying so.
Well, I won't keep you. I just wanted to welcome you to Hamden.
Thank you. I look forward to seeing you on Sunday.
Thank you.

I came in search of something I did not believe existed.
I've stayed on now in spite of myself,
in spite of everything I've ever held to be true.
I will continue here as long as I can...
as long as you are beset by the haunting illness...
which I saw consume your beautiful mind.
What is this discovery I've made?
How can I reconcile what I see with what I know?
I feel this was meant not for me to find,
but for you to make sense of...
make the connections which can't be ignored.
Connections which, for me, deny all logic and reason.
What is this source of power I hold in my hand... this rubbing?
This simple impression taken from the surface of the craft?
I watched this rubbing take its undeniable hold on you...
saw you succumb to its spiraling effect.
Now, I must work to uncover...
what your illness prevents you from finding.
In the source of every illness lies its cure.
Who's there?
Who's there?
He's been quiet for the last 36 hours.
But he doesn't sleep.
There's activity in the temporal lobe...
we've just never seen.
It won't allow his brain to rest or shut down,
manifesting in episodes of aggression.
Sometimes against himself.
- You can't sedate him? - Yes.
We slow him down for short periods and put him in the neuro ward.
It's the only way we're able to run tests.
But over time,
his brain is going to just die.
Agent Mulder?
Agent Mulder, can you hear me?
Do you know who I am?
It's Skinner. Walter Skinner.
Can we get him out of here? Get him some fresh air, at least?
Let him go! He can't breathe!
Come on. Let him go.
- Stay there, Mr. Skinner.
No, it's all right. Just let me get up.
- Five milligrams of haloperidol, I.M.
- I want him in five-point restraints.
Yes, sir.
My God.
What happened here?
They said you speak English.
- What do you want? -  I'm sorry.
You must wonder who I am. I'm Amina Ngebe.
I have come to see your discovery.
I asked that no one be told about it, nor that I'm here.
Yes, well, it is still a secret,
but a well-known one, I'm afraid.
Dr. Merkmallen called it the 'African internet. "God rest him.
You knew Dr. Merkmallen?
I, too, am a professor of biology at the university.
But, uh, hardly one qualified to say what must have gone on here.
Well, I was working late last night by lamplight,
and, uh, I saw a man who vanished.
And then they just swarmed.
You must not let the men know...
what happened to you last night.
The vanishing man, none of it.
Why?
They are animists,
believing nature is vengeful.
They'll take this as a sign to leave what you have found alone.
- A bad omen. - Caused by the ship out there?
Mmm. Caused by God,
who will be much less helpful than those men...
if we are to continue this work.
Quick! He's gotta get to a hospital!
- Hospital!
Okay!
You see? Another warning.
Agent Mulder?
I want to help you.
I don't know what to do. I don't have much time.
Can you write?
I feel you slipping away from me with every minute I fail here.
What are the elusive meanings I cannot see...
that are hidden here?
If I could understand it, know how it affected you,
learn how to use its power to save you...
What is it?
Look, I'm sorry. I don't speak your language.
Perhaps you need an interpreter?
Stay away from me!
Are you gonna hack me up in front of my driver?
Murderer of who?
Dr. Merkmallen.
I murdered no one. But I won't be sent away from here.
I know what we've got.
This craft that's come ashore, its extraterrestrial origins.
You don't even believe in that.
Nor do you, but here we are.
I'm here only to help my partner.
Then let me help you...
to read it.
I've spent my life looking for what's out there.
The answer to what theologians have pondered for millennia.
The key to everything... to life itself.
I've already been threatened...
by men in Washington about what I know.
How long would your secret keep if you were to send me away?
What is it?
It is a sea of blood.
Yeah.
- Michael Kritschgau? - It's 6:00 in the morning.
I don't know if you remember me. My name's Skinner.
He's in a serious condition, Mr. Kritschgau. He asked to talk to you.
I got nothin' to say to the man.
You know, I had a job...
with a government pension coming.
And two years ago, Fox Mulder asked me to do him a favor.
Blow the whistle on Uncle Sam's U.F.O. propaganda mill.
And all it got me was this swanky address.
Look, he doesn't have much time.
Hey, I'm not a doctor. What is it you think I can do for him?
All I know is that he asked for you.
Can he even recognize me?
To be honest, I don't know.
- Agent Mulder?
His brain is on constant redline.
They've got him on haloperidol just to keep him on the monitors.
- Haloperidol? - He becomes violently agitated.
He just won't speak or sleep, even when he's medicated.
There's activity in part of his brain they've never seen before.
- Was his...
Was his what?
I started to ask you a question about his prior mental state,
but he anticipated it.
Second time.
- Agent Mulder?
He claimed to be hearing voices.
I might know why Agent Mulder asked for me.
I think he responded to a question that... I didn't ask.
You asked me to come down here.
You better be prepared to accept the responsibility, Mr. Skinner.
- You're going to inject him? - No. You are.
With a thousand milligrams of phenytoin.
He's being given the wrong treatment.
- You're not a doctor. - No, but I've seen his condition.
Who do you want to trust?
Seen it where?
In a study.
There's something like E.S.P. called "remote viewing."
Extreme subjects would go into arrest,
their minds working harder than their bodies could sustain.
They became, in effect, all brain.
Agent Mulder knew about this.
That's why he asked for you.
They're coming.
- Who last saw him? - I'm looking here.
I come here and find a patient missing, and nobody knew?
Well, I just came on. Sorry. Uh, Fox Mulder, right?
He's restrained, it says. And he's not in his bed?
No. How many times can I say it?
He's right here.
He wasn't here when I came in.
No, we just found him down the hall.
- I just got him back into bed. - Who are you?
- I'm his boss, and hers. - Well, I don't know...
how he could've gotten up by himself or pulled all this stuff out.
Well, I hope someone's calling a doctor and making a report on this.
Well, I hope someone's calling a doctor and making a report on this.
He has got to remain in this bed.
I'll stay with him.
Agent Fowley, why don't you see if you can help her.
That's an order, Agent Fowley.
She knows.
- You can read her mind? - Yeah.
- We gotta act fast. - The doctor's on his way.
- No doctors. Get me Scully. - I don't know where she is.
Look, I know you've been compromised.
I know Krycek is threatening your life,
blackmailing you.
You don't think I can trust you.
But it's not you that I need.
- Then who? - Him.
Kritschgau.
- Ask him to prove it. - Prove what?
What's causing this.
It's a brain abnormality. It's how you're able to read minds.
What's causing this is alien. It's why my doctors can't help me.
I don't believe in aliens, Agent Mulder. I think you know that.
I do. That's why I need you.
The work here is painstaking.
A slow and tedious piecing together.
It appears to be a craft...
its skin covered in the intricate symbols you and I both saw,
but which I now understand are part of a complex communication.
Dr. Barnes has broken some of the symbols into letters,
using an ancient Navaho alphabet.
And though it has helped to uncover some of what's here,
it has also made for greater confusion.
On the top surface of the craft, I'm finding words...
describing human genetics.
Efforts to read the bottom of the craft have been harder.
Our workers were scared away by a phenomena I admit I can't explain.
A sea of blood, a swarm of insects.
But what little we've found has been staggering.
Passages from the Christian Bible,
from Pagan religions, from ancient Sumaria.
Science and mysticism conjoined.
But more than words, they are somehow imbued with power.
I've ignored warnings to quit this work,
remaining committed to finding answers,
afraid only that our secret here won't last...
and that I might be too late.
I have something to show you.
More pieces of the puzzle.
I couldn't believe it.
I thought I was making it up in my head,
- That it could not be true. - What?
What this is.
What the symbols spell out is a passage from the Koran.
Quyama... the day of final judgement.
On a spacecraft,
teachings of the ancient prophet Mohammed?
I found more too.
Twenty-four panels.
One for each human chromosome.
A map of their makeup. Maybe a map...
of our entire genetic makeup.
A complete human genome.
I mean, it's like...
it's the most beautiful, intricate work of art.
It is the word of God.
You're wrong.
There is no God.
What's out there in the water...
is only what we call "God"...
what we call "creation."
The spark that ignited the fire that cooked...
the old primordial soup.
Made animate from inanimate. Made us.
I believe he is mad from the sun.
Mad? I'm perfectly sane.
Because today, I understand everything.
Beginning and end, alpha and omega, everything in between.
It's all been written, but the word is extraterrestrial.
You're sick, Dr. Barnes.
You need to get off your feet.
Lie down.
You think you're going to take the credit?
This is my discovery.
I'm only here to help my friend.
You can't help him.
You're wasting your time reading it.
It has power.
It is power.
The ultimate power.
Your friend just got too close.
No one leaves here before me.
We developed this to test remote viewing capabilities.
It works much like a card trick.
You tap the monitor where the saucer image appears,
when it appears, or when you think it does.
Okay?
Who are you gonna call?
Now.
Now. Now.
Now. Now.
Now. Now.
- Now. - All right, Agent Mulder. Fine.
You're at about five percent accuracy.
I'm assuming that's low.
Yeah. At the C.I.A., a high degree of ability was 20 percent.
- Twenty-five percent was extraordinary. - But I see them in my head.
You saw his ability earlier. It was you who pointed it out.
Well, our tests show that some people have psychic ability, sure.
I mean, E.S.P., clairvoyance, remote viewing.
But it was never attributed to aliens.
You don't want to believe.
You're not looking hard enough.
One more time... faster.
He's ahead of the images.
He's anticipating them.
They've come back!
They were dead!
They've come back to life!
The ship... it brought them back to life!
We have to get to the police.
That is where I am going. This is the road to Abajan.
- Stop!
That was him!
That was the man I saw in the tent... in the road.
Some truths are not for you.
- Are you all right?
- Oh, God. What are you doing? - You were cold.
I was just feeling to see if you were still alive.
- What happened to you? - To me?
You slammed on the brakes. There was a man.
- That's right... in the road. - No.
He was right there, sitting right where you are in your seat.
The men were right. This is a bad sign.
A sign to give up.
- Turn us around. - Not back to the beach.
No. I'm going home.
Agent Mulder?
Agent Mulder, I don't know if you can hear me,
but we're gonna try to get you out of here.
A.M. nurse is on in five minutes.
- We gotta move. - I don't think he's in any shape.
I'm gonna hit him pretty hard.
Maybe we can get him on his feet.
- What are you doing? - Look, I know what you're doing.
- I'm trying to help him. - This isn't about him.
It's about you. It's about revenge against the government...
for trying to destroy your life.
I was destroyed to protect what Mulder knew all along. Now he's the proof.
- It's gone too far. - How far should it go?
How far would Mulder go?
- Hey, what's going on here?
Let me see your hands. Hands!
Step away.
Agent Fowley, what the hell do you think you're doing?
What am I doing? What are you doing, sir, with this?
I want you to face the wall.
Do you hear me? Face the wall!
- Let me explain. - What was this man given?
What was in this syringe?
Phenytoin.
Let me tell you what it does.
How much did you give him? What dosage was this?
- Let me tell you why we did it.
He's going into seizure!
Watch his head!
Mr. Mulder?
Hold him. Hold him.
Dr. Barnes?
Dr. Barnes?
- I'm so sorry.
I know what's happened to you.
I know what you're suffering from.
I've been sitting back and watching.
I know you know.
I know you know about me.
That my loyalties aren't just to you,
but to a man you've grown to despise.
You have your reasons.
But as you look inside me now, you know that I have mine.
Fox?
Fox, I love you.
I've loved you for so long.
You know that too.
And I won't let you die...
to prove what you are... to prove what's inside you.
There's no need to prove it.
It's been known for so long.
Now we can be together.
-  Where is he?
- Is he still in the hospital? - Where have you been?
Is he still at Georgetown Memorial?
He's in the neuro psych ward, but it's no good, Agent Scully.
- Agent Scully! - I have been on a plane for 22 hours.
if you can even get on the ward.
There's been some trouble.
What kind of trouble?
- I got this man Kritschgau involved. - Kritschgau?
It's a long story, but it ended badly.
They've got Mulder under security now around the clock.
I take full responsibility.
Responsibility for what?
He can't even communicate, Agent Scully.
They won't treat him because they don't know what's wrong with him.
They said he was dying. I had to do something.
He's not dying.
I'm afraid it's true.
He's not dying.
He is more alive than he's ever been.
He's more alive than his body can withstand.
And what's causing it may be extraterrestrial in origin.
I know.
But there's nothing to be done about it.
They're going to deny you access.
Maybe as his partner,
but not as his doctor.
He's alive.
He's come back to life.
Holy Mother of God!
Hello?
Please.
I need to see him.
I'm begging you, please.
Thank you.
Mulder, it's me.
I know that you can hear me.
If you can just give me some sign.
I want you to know where I've been...
what I found.
I think that if you know,
that you could find a way to hold on.
I need you to hold on.
I found a key...
the key...
to every question that has ever been asked.
It's a puzzle.
But the pieces are there for us to put together.
And I know that they can save you if you can just hold on.
Mulder?
Please.
Hold on.

Almost home now, Jason. What do we say?
Sticks and stones may break my bones,
but words can never hurt me.
Keep your chin up, son. We'll get through this just fine.
Jason, have you got a comment? How do you feel, Jason?
Back up! Back up, there!
Okay, folks, come on out. You're safe now.
Just step out and stay in front of me. We'll get you in your house.
- Come on, son. - Just stay in front of me.
There you go, sweetheart.
If you need anything during the night,
if you don't feel well, you just ring that bell, okay?
Okay, Mom.
Good night, Jason.
I know you're afraid.
Maybe you think those people outside are right...
that we should take you to the hospital and let the doctors treat you.
We could do that.
And they might take away your cancer and your body might feel better,
but not your soul.
It's God himself who gave you this illness, Jason,
for reasons that are his.
If you're to be well in body and spirit,
it's God who must come to deliver you.
Good morning. Here's a story to warm the cockles of your heart, Scully.
"An 11-year-old boy diagnosed with lymphatic cancer cured with a miracle."
Jason McPeck. Goochland, Virginia.
Oh.
Yeah, his parents refused treatment on religious grounds.
His faith forbids medical aid,
and soJason's cure was delivered by angels.
Well, spontaneous remission, Mulder, isn't completely unheard of.
So-called "miracle" recoveries attributable...
to no clear cause or reason.
It's not the miracle I'm suspicious of. It's the messenger.
That came as an anonymous e-mail to me...
from the Defense Advance Research Projects Agency.
- DARPA? - Someone at DARPA.
How'd you hear about it?
You subscribe to the Goochland Guardian?
No.
So this just appeared miraculously on your doorstep this morning?
As far as I can tell, I was the only one to whom it was delivered.
Someone wants us on this case.
- It's not a case, Mulder. - Yeah, not yet.
I'm gonna go back over to DARPA.
You see what else you can find out about that boy.
I just gotta know whether it was Roma Downey or Della Reese.
- Yes? - Hi.
I'm Dana Scully with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
- Are you Mrs. McPeck? - What can we do for you?
I'm here about your son.
- Are we under investigation? - Uh, no.
I-I was just hoping to better understand what happened to him.
- May I ask, is he okay? - Jason, you've got somebody to see you.
- Tell her how you're feeling. - I feel good.
Just a little out of breath.
You're looking at God's work.
Jason's life owes to his grace and exalts his name in the highest.
And you say that you saw angels?
- Yes. - May I ask what they looked like?
They looked like men.
They came from the sky in a ball of light.
- And what did they say? - They said not to be afraid.
Then one of them pinched me kind of hard.
- And then I was better right away. - He pinched you? Where?
Right here.
- What the hell are you doing? - God's work. What else?
who saved that young boy's life, and yours.
You got your light. Now get out.
You're not at all curious...
about the chip that's been put in that boy's neck?
You, a medical doctor, who has the same technology in your body,
who's witnessed this wondrous miracle firsthand?
I've taken considerable trouble to prove my intentions.
The newspaper at your door, the e-mail to Mulder,
the elaborate demonstration of curing this boy's cancer.
You see, I'm dying myself.
A dying man who wants to make right... to share his secrets...
and to bequeath this cure to millions of others, just like that boy.
So you wanna give it to us?
To you, Agent Scully.
I've tired of Mulder's muleheadedness.
His foolish ideas of overthrowing the system.
You think I'm fooled by this?
I made you my offer.
Agent Mulder hears a breath of this, rest assure I'll rescind it.
Take it to my grave.
- Yes, I need a trace on a D.C. area phone number.
I need an address. Thank you.
- May I help you? - I'm sorry. I made a mistake.
- May I see some identification?
Look, is this necessary? I just walked through the wrong door.
Your identification, please.
- Look... - Third floor.
Agent Scully.
Please, sit.
- I'm glad you came. - You obviously knew that I would.
In the end...
a man finally looks at the sum of his life...
to see what he'll leave behind.
Most of what I worked to build is in ruins.
And now that the darkness descends,
I find I have no real legacy.
What are you dying of?
Cerebral inflammation.
A consequence of brain surgery I had in the fall.
The doctors give me just a few months.
So you want to use me to clear the slate...
to make you a respectable person?
It won't work.
How many people in the world are dying of cancer?
And here we are wasting time with the past.
I'm here. Where is it?
This miracle cure of yours.
We'll need to take a trip. It will require a few days.
I'll get back to you.
I have access, Agent Scully.
I have these miraculous chips, but the genetic research that makes them work...
is closely guarded.
There are men in this building who would kill me if they knew...
what I'd offered you.
They'd kill you too in the blink of an eye.
I've destroyed a lot of things in my life,
including the people most precious to me.
All I want is a chance to do something in service to man before I go.
Call received 8:01 p.m.
Mulder, it's me. I wanted to let you know...
that I'll be out of town for a day or two.
It's a family emergency.
I'll call you when I can.
- This is Dana Scully. I'm not in right now.
- Please leave a message after the beep.
Hey, Scully, it's me. Pick up if you're there.
Scully, you there?
All right, I just... I got your message, and I hope everything's okay.
I'll try you on your cell right now.
You're going to smoke?
- It's time I quit. - Just like that?
No sacrifice is purely altruistic.
We give, expecting to receive.
What exactly is it you expect to receive?
Your trust.
You question my sincerity. You think I'm heartless.
Would it soften your opinion of me if I confessed that...
I've always had a particular affection for you?
I assure you, my intentions are honorable.
I have affection for Mulder too.
My affection for you is special.
I held your life in my hands.
Your cancer was terminal, and I had a cure.
Can you imagine what that's like?
To have the power to extinguish a life...
or to save it and let it flourish?
Now to give you that power...
so you can do the same.
She said it was a family matter.
Dropped off the key, asked me to water the plants. No biggie.
A great girl. Independent as they come, you know?
- She's a great girl. - Yeah, yeah.
Tenants like having an F.B.I. agent in the building.
Gives them a sense of security.
Do you know how many people have died in there?
- We don't talk about that. - You said she was carrying a suitcase.
Did you notice anything else? Anything abnormal?
No, no. Actually, it wasn't her carrying the suitcase.
- It was her driver. - Her driver?
Yeah, an older guy. Tall.
I've seen him here before. Smokes like a chimney.
Hey, don't you want...
You've been at the wheel too long. Would you like me to drive?
I might if you let me know where we're going.
Knowing that, you'd feel comfortable? You'd trust me?
How long did it take Mulder to win your trust?
I've always trusted Mulder.
You're not being honest with yourself. Think back.
There was a time when you feared for your future, for your career,
when you were first partnered with this man.
I told you, I've studied you for years.
And if you would permit me, I'd like to make an observation.
You're drawn to powerful men,
but you fear their power.
You keep your guard up... a wall around your heart.
How else do you explain that fearless devotion...
to a man obsessed and a life alone?
You'd die for Mulder,
but you won't allow yourself to love him.
Wow.
I'm learning a whole other side to you.
You're not just a coldblooded killer. You're a pop psychologist as well.
I've been a destroyer all my life.
Before I die,
I'd like to prove that I'm capable of something more.
- Turn here, on the left. - Where are we going?
To show you what I'm capable of.
Her name's Marjorie Butters. She's got quite a green thumb.
Plays a mean game of Scrabble, if you're interested.
And what's her relationship to you?
Well, how should I put it?
You could say that I'm her angel.
Marjorie's 118 years old.
- Oh! - I thought I'd surprise you.
Marjorie, this is Dana Scully. She's a very good friend of mine.
- Nice to meet you. - My pleasure.
Well, come inside. I baked some fresh bread this morning.
And there are tomatoes from the garden.
I'll put the kettle on.
To have this power...
to visit this woman and see her joy...
It must be why you became a doctor.
I'll expect your call. Thanks.
She requisitioned a fleet sedan when she left the Bureau yesterday.
I don't know why, and there have been no fuel charges.
Her mother doesn't know anything about a family emergency.
Look, I know you're worried about the company that she's in.
But from what you've told me, it's not like she's sneaking out.
And the truth is, she's gone to a lot of trouble to allay your fears.
I know she can take care of herself.
It's just not like her to lie to me.
That's my private line.
- Skinner. -  Sir?
- Agent Scully, where are you? - I'm on the road.
- I'm sorry to call you on this line. - It's all right.
It's just we've been worried about you.
Everything's okay. I just wanted you to express that to Mulder.
Can you tell him that I'll call him later? Just tell him that I'm fine.
She said she's fine.
She's in trouble.
I'm going to the restroom.
Mulder, I'm trusting you'll be able to make sense of what's on this tape.
I had no other way of contacting you.
Please try and understand that I weighed the risks.
I couldn't divulge these plans without risking them,
and I promise you that I weighed everything.
Our current location is northbound on the Upstate Expressway.
We're driving my F.B.I. fleet sedan.
I promise I will get these tapes to you as fast as I can.
Oh! Excuse me.
Lifesaver?
You may as well get comfortable. We've got a good drive ahead.
It's the masters of disguise.
- Can we laugh it up in your apartment? - We got heat on our tail.
We did what you asked, pulled up what we could on Scully.
We started with her credit cards to see if she purchased any airline tickets.
And ended up hacking into some defense department node.
Where they demanded that we immediately identify ourselves...
or face prosecution for espionage or crimes against the government.
What does this have to do with finding Scully?
When we went into her computer, we found a series of deleted transmissions.
E-mail that had been erased from her sub-directories, but not her hard drive.
- A series of communications. - From someone named Cobra.
Who the hell is Cobra? Scully would have told me about him.
Well, looks like she's gone to great lengths to keep this from you.
I don't believe that. She knows that I'd find her no matter what.
Mulder, we can't find her. There's nowhere to start looking.
Yeah, I don't believe that either.
Give me that.
How do you take your coffee?
Unadulterated, thank you.
You drugged me.
I did nothing of the sort.
How the hell did I get out of my clothes and into bed?
I carried you. You'd been up for over 30 hours.
You were delirious. I only wanted to make you comfortable.
- Where are we? - Milford, Pennsylvania.
Well, that wasn't part of the deal.
I don't know what you're up to.
The keys are in the ignition.
You're free to go, of course.
The choice is still yours.
Sir, I need your attention.
- Is my assistant... - No.
She's away from her desk. I wouldn't just bust in here,
- Is it secure? - Don't get testy, G-man.
Are you aware of a federal fugitive code-named Cobra?
For the past six months, Cobra's been e-mailing Scully...
from the Department of Defense where he works on a shadow project...
for advanced research.
- Is that what I'm looking at here? - No.
What they're pulling up is Scully's correspondence back to Cobra.
- She has a relationship? - No. Somebody posing as Scully...
who hacked into her computer and has been capturing all her e-mail,
passing themselves off as Scully in order to win Cobra's trust.
The last five exchanges hinted a meeting...
where they're gonna exchange information on the project Cobra's working on.
- A meeting? Where? -  Don't know.
- They just ended. - Who's been in her computer?
Smoking Man, or someone working for him.
You gotta get to him now.
You of all people should know that you just don't get to him.
If you don't get to him, it may be the last time we see Scully alive.
We'll be getting final instructions from our contact tonight.
He's... He's invited us to dinner.
I took the liberty of getting you something to wear.
It's, uh... It's beautiful.
I'm glad you like it.
I look forward to tonight.
- So your contact's going to join us? - I presume so.
You extol our great trust, but you still haven't told me who he is.
He is to human genetic science...
as Oppenheimer and Fermi were to the advent of nuclear warfare.
I'm still not clear what my importance is to this exchange.
This man... We'll call him Cobra...
he needs assurances...
that the science he's gonna hand over won't fall into the wrong hands.
- I've told him of you. He's expecting to meet you here.
Well...
to the future.
I must tell you something else.
Something that's so unbelievable,
so incredible,
that to know it is to look at the entire world anew.
What?
What we are being given, it's not the cure for cancer.
It's the holiest of grails, Dana.
It's the cure for all human disease.
How?
It's from that final frontier.
It's largely extraterrestrial.
Then you would be cured.
That which makes miracles...
can also make great evil.
There are those who would use this power for their own purposes.
To choose who will live and who will die.
Theoretically, I can be cured, but...
everything I've told you about wanting to make right?
I'm a lonely man, Dana.
Would you excuse me?
Cobra hasn't shown.
- What do you wanna do? - Wait. What else can we do?
What trust you've won...
Scully won't stick around forever.
What's wrong?
Just do your damn job.
Calico inlet's 15 minutes out. South end.
- What do I do when I get there? - I don't know. Just wait.
Be careful.
Finally we meet.
You're just as you described yourself. Certainly more so last night at dinner.
I only wish we could continue to correspond,
but it must end after this.
I hope one day we can take some time...
when I'm not a marked man.
This is it... the science I promised you.
Well, wait. Where did you get this?
- Where did it come from, this science? - Where did it come from?
- Who developed it? - Scully?
Yes, I'm Scully, but I don't believe we've spoken before or corresponded.
They shot him. They killed him.
And they shot at me.
I wouldn't have sent you if I thought there'd be any danger.
Dana.
Yes, I got it.
Forgive me.
Here. Take it. This is for you.
I gotta go.
Go.
There's nothing on this.
- It's empty. - Completely.
No. It can't be.
It can't be.
It's got to be on there.
He was here!
These were his offices. What the hell is this?
He used you.
Mulder, he laid it all out for me. I recorded it.
I mailed you the tape.
This old woman, Marjorie Butters, I met her.
I saw her pictures, her birth certificate.
You saw what you needed to see in order to make you believe.
Well, then what about this boy?
This boy with cancer? You can't deny that.
That's... That's undeniable proof.
Even if we could convince his parents to let us march him out,
how long before that chip in his neck mysteriously disappears?
This was the perfectly executed con, Scully.
And the only thing I can't figure out is why you're still alive.
Mulder, I looked into his eyes.
I swear what he told me was true.
The man's motives never changed.
You think he used me to save himself...
at the expense of the human race?
He knows what that science is worth, how powerful it is.
He'd let nothing stand in his way.
You may be right.
But for a moment, I saw something else in him.
A longing for something more than power.
Maybe for something he could never have.

- Hey. You sure I can't help? - Absolutely not.
- All set. - Oh, Martha, you make this look so easy.
It's exactly the way I always dreamt that Easter should be.
- Mommy, look! - Oh, good for you, Michelle.
What you've done is really fabulous. The kids are gonna remember this forever.
I hope there are some things they won't remember.
Jenny, hi. It's good to see you.
Hey, Ellen. Martha.
She's shaken up, Howard.
It took me two hours to put her to bed.
All I'm saying is...
No, I didn't see any bird.
But whatever it was, it scared her and she wants to be with her daddy.
That's all I'm saying.
Well, can't you come home one day early?
All right, fine.
I love you too.
- Anything? - No. She'll come.
It's a matter of time.
Well, I hope you realize there's no evidence whatsoever...
that this mystery woman of yours has even committed a crime.
Though her wardrobe comes close.
Ah. Six prostitutes were seen with her at Dirty Dames,
never to be seen again.
Not only might she be a female serial killer, rare in and of itself,
but twice police raided that club to arrest her.
And twice they came up empty-handed.
She's on tape goin' in, the exits are covered. She's nowhere to be found.
What happens to her? She disappeared? Turn invisible?
Well, I hope we catch her so she can tell us...
before I have to spend another night here.
This round-the-clock exposure to the seamy underbelly.
It's a job, Scully. Vigilance in the face of privation.
The sheer will that it takes to sit in this crappy room...
spying on the dregs of society until our suspect surfaces.
There is something ennobling in that.
Mulder.
Now?
All right. I gotta go.
Mulder?
- You wanted to see me, sir? - Yeah, sit down.
Two weeks ago, a woman named Martha Crittendon...
disappeared from her home in Bethany, Vermont.
Local police haven't turned up any sign of her.
I'm hoping you may be able to.
- I'm already on a case. - You're on a stakeout.
I'm confident Agent Scully can continue in your absence.
Why? What did I do?
There may be aspects to this that...
speak to your strengths as an investigator.
Specifically?
Ravens.
What do you know about 'em...
their mythological or paranormal significance?
Well, the, uh...
the raven is considered a very powerful symbol...
in certain Norse, Celtic and Native-American cultures.
Mostly a negative one.
And then, of course, there's Poe's Raven...
and Nevermore and all that stuff.
Martha Crittendon's seven-year-old daughter...
claimed she was attacked by a raven earlier the day her mother disappeared.
No, really, what did I do?
It's the only lead that hasn't been explored.
I wanna know if it has any bearing on the case.
I'm also assuming that the fact that Martha Crittendon's father...
is a federal judge also has a little bearing on this case?
It's been made clear to me that locating her is my top priority.
I'm making it yours as well.
- Agent Mulder? - Yeah.
Phil Adderly. Welcome to Bethany. I appreciate the help.
Sure. I don't know how much help I'm gonna be.
I know you had a lot of good investigators on the case.
So tell me about Martha Crittendon.
Well, she and my wife Ellen, they're best friends.
Martha's much admired here.
She's devoted to her family, active in the community.
I mean, needless to say, the whole town is very concerned.
There's no ransom note, no prints or blood evidence.
It checks out.
Howard didn't have anything to do with this.
What do you know about a raven?
Yeah, yeah. Michelle, their...
their little girl was saying something about that.
Got me.
Poor kid.
- You wanna talk to her? - Not necessary.
You sure, uh, Martha's last name isn't Stewart?
Tell me about it. Last year this place made the cover of New England Home.
How many talons would you say a raven had?
Never mind.
You know what this is? Do you know what was hanging here?
It was a mirror. It was found broken.
- You had no other signs of struggle? - Not a one.
- Does that mean somethin' to you?
Howard, this is Agent Mulder with the F.B.I.
Sir. I hope we can help.
I appreciate your coming.
I'm wondering now... if this isn't just a waste of your time.
How so?
With all the police coming and going,
this place is a wreck.
I was straightening up and I... found something.
Uh, birth control pills.
I think Martha was having an affair.
After Michelle, we decided not to have more children.
I had a vasectomy.
They're in Martha's name. She ordered them off the Internet.
Because I guess small towns talk.
Of course, then I started looking all around and I...
found this in the pocket of her favorite coat.
I don't know what this goes to...
or what it means, if anything.
But the pills...
Do you have any idea who your wife may have been seeing?
Whoever he is,
Martha may be with him.
It explains why we haven't found her.
She doesn't wanna be found.
Cute kid.
Oh, Jenny, you scared me.
- You do those up yourself? - Uh, yeah.
I know Martha and you were good friends. You must be pretty upset.
Of course. I'm sure we all are.
Maybe you'd like some to put up on your side of town.
My side of town?
You and Martha are two peas in a pod.
Jenny, I don't think I'm better than anyone.
You and me got more in common than you know.
Yeah, right.
Right. Thanks.
Whoever Martha was seeing, the two of them covered their tracks pretty good.
Phone records don't show anything. You think this person took her, harmed her?
I wouldn't rule it out, but I doubt it. According to your Audubon book,
a raven has four talons.
That matches the scratches we found on Martha Crittendon's mantle.
You're not saying a raven's the reason Martha's gone missing?
No, no, not a raven itself.
But in folklore, ravens are companions to evil...
evil spirits, witches, warlocks, that kind of thing.
but this whole bird thing?
And keep in mind, you're basing this on the word of a seven-year-old girl.
Well, there was also a broken mirror in Martha's house.
Mirrors are considered items of enchantment.
A broken one... means something.
I'm not exactly sure what it is, but... it means something.
Oh.
- Hey, sweet girl. - There's Papa.
Agent Mulder, this is my daughter Katie and my wife Ellen.
There's no arguments. We're so grateful that you're here to find Martha.
It's the least we can do.
Okay.
I should really get the bureau to reimburse you for room and board.
Bill works so much that supper is usually the only time we see each other.
- And I like to make it special.
Excuse me. Sorry.
Thanks.
- Mulder. - Mulder, please tell me I can go home.
Hey, Scully. How's the stakeout?
Well, the furnace broke and I can just about see my breath.
Ouch. Sorry to hear that.
Eeew.
But as of yet, no mystery woman.
Well, she'll come. You know, it's just a matter of time.
She'll show up. I'm sure of that.
Not before I die of malnutrition.
Scully, tough it out. Whatever doesn't kill you, makes you stronger, right?
- No, no. No capers. Thank you. - I'm sorry. What?
I said, "What a crazy caper." I'll talk to you later. And keep warm. Bye.
Did I hear you say something about stakeout? What's the case?
Sweetie, this is family time.
- Cheers. - Cheers.
What's the matter, sweetheart?
I thought that was your favorite.
It tastes different when Mommy makes it.
Yeah.
I know.
How 'bout we go get hamburgers?
Would you like that instead?
It's back.
What do you make of these claw marks?
Well, one time I saw the victim of a bear attack look something like that.
Only bears don't plant their kill in the rose garden.
I was gonna say.
The body's been around here for a while. Probably since she went missing.
What about your ravens?
Howard said something about ravens.
Yeah. Feedin' on her. See?
You okay?
I'm not arrestin' Howard. I don't care how it looks.
The poor guy's suffered enough already.
Oh, my God.
- Martha, no. - Ellen, honey, I am so sorry.
It can't be.
It's okay. It's okay.
The thing that did that to her,
I think I saw it today.
I saw its reflection.
It had a face out of a nightmare. These long claws, the kind that could...
The window shattered. I don't know how. And when I turned around, it was gone.
But then when I saw Martha's face...
Honey, you've been through a lot.
You don't believe me.
I do.
You said the car window shattered after you saw the reflection.
And there's a broken mirror in Martha's house.
I don't think that's a coincidence.
- But what could it mean? - Mirrors are considered doorways.
In the Victorian era, they built mirrored rooms called "psychomantiums,"
where they thought they could summon forth spirits from the spirit world.
Denizens from the spirit world were brought into this world.
"Denizens of the spirit world?"
You asked about the raven. The raven is a carrion bird...
attracted to death and decay.
What if... this entity that you saw...
is somehow a personification of that?
What if this creature was brought forth in order to attack Martha?
Then the question becomes who summoned it forth.
Ellen, do you know if Martha had any enemies?
Can you think of anyone at all who would have wished her harm?
I sure as hell didn't have anything to do with it.
We understand there was no love lost between you and Martha Crittendon.
And where do you understand that from?
- Mrs. Sheriff, right? - It's not exactly a town secret.
Right. Like there aren't enough of those already.
Queen Martha and her perfect little Easter egg hunts.
She's so above the rest of us.
Except I heard she was steppin' out on her husband,
knockin'boots with who knows who.
I'm not happy she's dead and all. But you need to look into that.
Well, let's stay on the subject of you... on your police record, for instance.
You don't suffer people that don't give you respect.
I'm thinking of that hair salon owner you assaulted.
That was forever ago. And I paid for that.
And I had nothing to do with Martha.
Where were you the night she disappeared?
At home, all night.
I gotta get back to work.
I don't know about you, but I believe her.
She didn't do it. I just don't get that vibe.
Fair enough. But why did she lie about her alibi?
I got that vibe pretty clear.
- Excuse me.
I'll be in the car.
Mulder.
Mulder, when you find me dead,
my desicated corpse propped up...
staring lifelessly through the telescope...
at drunken frat boys peeing and vomiting into the gutter,
just know that my last thoughts were of you...
and how I'd like to kill you.
I'm sorry. Who is this?
It's a freak show, Mulder.
It's a nonstop parade of every single lowlife imaginable.
The view may not be too different here. It's dressed up nicer,
but underneath the surface it's the same seamy underbelly.
It's not the same. Trust me.
- And I could use your help. - You talking about a reprieve for me?
Well, there's a murder victim I'd like you to autopsy. What do you think?
Scully, you still there? Hello?
- That van is back. - What'd you say?
- Nothing, Mulder. I'll talk to you later, okay?
Katie...
Get away from her!
- It's okay, hon. Come on.
Be quiet now. Shh.
Hush. Be quiet.
Oh, God. Ellen?
Ellen, what happened?
Are you feeling a little better, Ellen?
Can you... just talk to me a little bit about what happened?
It came back.
It came back? The... The creature you saw?
It was here, Phil. It chased me.
It's all right, honey.
Please don't encourage this. This is not what she needs.
- I believe she saw something. - And I believe she didn't.
Her best friend just died, for God's sake.
These imaginings of hers are brought on by stress.
- What about the two broken mirrors? - What about them?
And in this case, I'm thinking Ellen broke 'em herself.
What?
- What would this be doing here? - I don't know.
Ellen, do you recognize this key?
Oh, I was... sweeping the floor...
and it got caught up in the sweeper.
I never saw it before today.
You found it before you were attacked?
Right before.
Right before I saw the raven.
Let me see if my department can run this down and find out what lock it goes to.
Hey, I can't do this anymore.
- Can't, huh? - No.
- We gotta stop. - Well, that's too bad.
- Hey, good morning. - Good morning, Ellen.
Wow.
- Have you seen my shirt? - Oh, I'm sorry.
- I left it... - It's over here.
Oh, Ellen, you didn't have to go to the trouble.
No, it's no trouble. Actually, it helps me.
Whenever my life's a mess, I just do some housework.
Gives me the illusion I'm in control.
- Well, maybe I should try that sometime. - Have a seat.
Thanks.
Yikes. Wow.
It's just Phil's breakfast times two.
Well, Phil is living large. Where is he this morning?
Uh, probably out on a call.
He'll be back. You... You just dig in.
- Whoa. Ow. - Sorry.
- Do you need milk? - Mm-mm. I'm fine.
I get the feeling you're not used to anyone taking care of you.
Well, that has a... a vaguely pathetic ring to it.
No, I just meant I didn't notice a wedding band.
- Oh. - Do you have a significant other?
Um, not in the widely understood definition of that term.
Oh. Well, the right woman will come along and change all that.
Don't miss out on home and family, Mr. Mulder.
With all the terrible things you must see in your work...
Well, it could be a refuge for you.
- Hi, honey. - Sorry I'm late. Paperwork.
- Good morning, Agent Mulder. - Good morning.
I'm gonna go check on Katie.
You sleep well?
I only woke up once, when you went out.
Well, I'll try to be quieter next time.
We've got a deputy out. We're shorthanded.
I had to take some calls.
- All night? - Yeah. We were busy.
I spoke to the coroner this morning.
The autopsy shows Martha Crittendon was four weeks pregnant when she died,
despite her birth control pills.
Probably didn't even know it. Any idea who the father might be?
I mean, Howard's vasectomy pretty much puts him out of the running.
Any inkling who it might be?
Just say what's on your mind, Agent.
You have a piece of evidence in your possession that I'd like back.
The skeleton key. Number six.
You wanna tell me what this unlocks?
Once I find out, we'll talk again.
I'm gonna hit the shower.
I know, Brett, sweetie, I'm sorry.
No, I'm gonna be home real soon.
Mommy had to work a double shift.
I know. I'm gonna come home and make you breakfast.
No, no, no, don't eat a lot of cookies. No.
Only two. I...
Yes, oatmeal cookies have oatmeal in them.
Okay. All right, three.
I love you.
Bye.
Sheriff, you know that talk I said we should have?
I left her sleeping.
So, you were having an affair with both Jenny and Martha Crittendon?
I cared about both of them.
They knew about each other?
But I'm assuming Ellen doesn't?
No.
But even if she did, she'd find a way to rationalize it.
I'm not defending myself,
but... two years ago I wanted a divorce.
Ellen won't hear it.
She got pregnant with Katie and locked me up good.
Well, I figure you got bigger problems facing you right now.
I didn't do this. I swear to you.
Anyway, what about the broken mirrors and the raven?
You said that it was an entity that did this. Don't you still believe that?
I said it was an entity summoned by somebody else.
Whether or not they even knew about it, is that possible?
Can I be the reason for all this...
and not even know about it?
Hi. You've reached the Adderly's... Phil, Ellen and Katie.
- Please leave a message.
Ellen, this is Phil. I was really hopin' you'd be home.
Look, I'm in a bit of a situation here...
and there's things we need to talk about.
But Agent Mulder's on his way over there to explain it all to you.
So, if you get this message, you just wait for him, okay? Thanks.
I think this sleepy little girl needs a nap.
I do.
I love you.
Go to sleep now. Okay, baby?
Ellen?
Ellen?
Mulder.
- Mulder, I am free. - You're free?
Mm-hmm. I'm gonna go home, take a shower for,
I don't know, eight or nine hours,
burn the clothes that I'm wearing and then sleep until late spring.
- You solved the X-File. - Yes.
Except it's not an X-File, Mulder.
What are you saying? You didn't catch our blond mystery serial killer?
Oh, no, we caught her.
But, uh, she isn't a serial killer.
Nor is she a blond.
And she isn't even a she.
What are you talking about?
What I'm talking about is these six missing prostitutes aren't dead, Mulder.
They are alive and well in a halfway house...
that was set up by this mystery blond...
who happens to go by the name of Mark Scott Eggbert.
And Mr. Eggbert wishes to acquaint lost souls...
with the teachings of Christ.
And that's his hook, I guess.
He dresses up like a fellow prostitute...
to make the girls feel at ease.
But this vanishing act is no more paranormal...
than a change of wardrobe, Mulder.
He goes into a place like a woman and comes out as a man.
- Right under... - Our noses.
Exactly. A wolf in sheep's clothing.
Or I guess in this case, a sheep in wolf s clothing.
Well, good work, Scully. I'll call you back later.
Ellen?
- Ellen, it's Agent Mulder. - Please go away.
Ellen, Jenny Uphouse is dead.
Do you?
Ellen, you went out... this morning after breakfast.
Where'd you go?
It's not me. It can't be.
I think it is.
Ellen, I think you have a whole other side that you're afraid to face.
That would explain all the broken mirrors.
You don't want to see yourself for what you really are.
Ellen, you have to come out of there.
Then what?
My marriage, my life?
Everything I thought I had...
is nothing.
It's all lies.
I wish you'd never come here.
Ellen, you need to open this door.
You wanna see her?
Does she wanna see me?
The doctors say she's got some kind of dissociative disorder.
A split personality.
That doesn't explain what happened, does it?
There's some multiple personality disorders...
where an alternate personality displays traits that the host doesn't have,
like nearsightedness or high blood pressure or even diabetes.
I think in Ellen's case, the... changes were just a lot more extreme.
Like... Jekyl and Hyde?
She wanted so much from her life with you.
A perfect life.
I don't know when, but at some point she did.
Like you said, I think she had to rationalize that.
And she just bottled up her anger.
Swallowed it, and it had to come out some way.
I think she did what she did to protect her family.

Max?
Max, you there?
You're late, kid.
It's way past his bedtime, Max.
He's not cut out for this.
Cut out for what?
Oh, there's more here than just trees.
Before you can find out what,
I gotta know that you're not gonna tell anyone about this place.
I won't. I swear.
It's a vow, Tony. Don't make it if you're gonna break it.
I won't break it, man. Not ever.
No matter what?
Even if someone dies tonight?
Anthony Reed.
- Got any outstanding warrants? - No, of course not.
- Look, I was just taking a walk. - Uh-huh.
Right past all those big "no trespassing" signs?
Now you just stand there for a minute.
Come on, man. I didn't do anything.
I wish I had a nickel for every time I had to drag you kids out of these woods.
It'd be a lot of nickels. Do you have any calls from dispatch?
Sir?
Dispatch to Foster. I didn't copy your last transmission.
Officer?
Dispatch to Foster, do you copy?
Deputy Foster, this is Dispatch. Do you copy?
Deputy Foster, sir, what's your 20?
Oh. There you are. Heavy traffic?
A sheriff s deputy is slain during a routine patrol.
It's a tragic occurrence, but I don't see the mystery here, Mulder.
Except said that the deputy was beaten to death by an invisible assailant.
Yes, but that's according to the young man who's accused of his murder.
One Tony Reed, and I'm guessing wrongfully accused.
He's an "A" student, moved here a few months ago from Philadelphia.
He's never been in trouble in his life.
Maybe. Take a look at the body.
The former Deputy Ronald Foster.
As you can see, the report doesn't quite do it justice.
Oh, my God. It looks like he was hit with a sledgehammer.
Police flashlight.
One blow.
Damage to the maxilla facial bones and the cranium...
is consistent with a blunt force trauma, but...
I'd say that Tony eats his Wheaties.
Check out the back of his head.
His eyeglasses.
Penetrated to the back of his skull.
Babe Ruth couldn't hit this hard, let alone a high school sophomore.
- No, his tox screen came back negative. - Well, even so,
enable feats of near super human strength.
Agent Mulder? How long you plannin' on bein'down here?
Sheriff Harden, this is my partner, Agent Scully.
How long you plan on bein' down here?
I'd like Ron left in peace. I don't know what there is to see anyway.
I got the murder weapon with bloody fingerprints,
- Well, uh, we're done here, right? - Mm-hmm.
But, Sheriff Harden, you won't mind if I talk to Tony Reed, do you?
I mean, it won't hurt your case. And if he did do it, you'll wanna know why.
What?
Well, Tony, this must be your lucky day for visitors.
- This is Agent Scully with the F.B. I... - I'm not talkin' anymore, okay?
Well, that might make things worse.
They seem pretty bad already.
In your statement, you say that Deputy Foster stopped you.
But you don't say why.
Come on. You were cruisin', right?
I mean, a small town like this, you're not exactly livin' la vida loca.
I know. I grew up in Dullsville too. Nothing to do but drive and park.
How long ago was that? Look.
Don't you think I know what you're doing?
If you didn't do it, it's all the more reason to clear it up.
Everything I know... is in my statement.
Okay, but bear with us, 'cause we're old and stupid.
How long was it between the time you heard the scream...
to the time that you found Deputy Foster?
Tony, you're not likely to get a fairer hearing than this.
Maybe ten, fifteen seconds.
You didn't see anyone near the patrol car? You didn't hear anything?
And you're still gonna stick with your story...
that you were the only one there, is that right?
Uh...
I wanna go back to my cell.
Sixteen years old and his life is over unless he starts tellin' the truth.
If you really think he's guilty, why don't you ask yourself this:
Why wouldn't he make up a more plausible cover story?
Why didn't he say that a pickup full of hillbillies...
drove by and clobbered the deputy and ran away?
I'm not saying he's guilty.
I'm inclined to agree that Tony Reed did not commit murder.
But I think that he saw the person who did, and he may be covering up for it.
I'm not sure there was a person to see. I think there was a force at work here.
Poltergeists have long been associated with violent acts like this,
and they tend to manifest around young people.
They seem to be drawn to the turmoil of adolescence.
Mulder, rather than spirits,
can we at least start with Tony's friends?
Please, just... for me?
I think there's one person in particular I'd like to talk to.
Let's wrap it up, people.
Two-minute warnin'.
There goes half your grade, Max.
- You missed the midterm. - Not if I take it right now.
- In one minute? - Oh, I've been studying.
I don't care who your father is.
You fail my test, it sticks.
I guess I better ace it then, huh?
Take your seat, young man.
- Piece of cake. - It is when you mark 'em at random.
Go ahead. Check it.
Maybe I got more goin' on than people know.
- He didn't kill that cop. - How can you be so sure?
- Tony just doesn't have it in him. - Do you?
Were you there when it happened?
Look, I gotta go.
Chastity, if you know something, now's the time to mention it.
Let's go.
- How do you know who my dad is? - You got the same last name.
Oh, you're good.
We're done here. Come on, babe.
You must've been a Betty back in the day.
- A "Betty"? - "Back in the day."
Scully.
What about the murder weapon?
All I know is we put the flashlight in here and now it's gone.
It's like it just disappeared into thin air.
What does the tape show?
That no unauthorized persons came in and no one went anywhere near this locker.
- Was this here before? - I don't know.
Can we take a look at the surveillance tape?
You can see that the flashlight was properly secured.
It's not like we're runnin'some kind of half-assed operation here.
No one's saying that you are, Sheriff.
Here's when the state police showed up to take it to the crime lab.
There's me goin'to get it.
We opened up the locker, and it's gone.
- May I? - I watched it a dozen times.
Plus, there's no gap in the time code.
The murder weapon was the only hard evidence we had.
Without it, we got no case.
You know what I gotta do now?
I gotta call Ron Foster's widow and tell her that I gotta turn his killer loose.
Scully, check this out.
- What am I supposed to be seeing? - Here it comes.
Now you see it.
One more frame. Now you don't.
What do you make of that, Scully? Take another look.
Now it's here.
Now it's not.
Are you ready to be straight with me?
Leave me alone, Mom. Would you just leave me alone.
I'm tired!
This isn't like a bad report card, Anthony. A man is dead.
I told you, I didn't do it!
It's just that what you say happened doesn't make sense.
There's gotta be more to it.
Well, there isn't. Okay?
Are those kids involved in this? That boy Max?
No.
- You don't even know them. - I do know them. I was your age once.
Tony, we came here to get a fresh start,
get away from them bad schools, the wrong crowd.
You are doing so well here.
How would you know? You're never around.
You think it's my dream to work two jobs?
I'm doin' it for you, Tony.
I just wanna get some sleep. That's all I want.
You got a chance at a good life,
a real future.
We didn't come all this way so you could throw it away.
Listen to that, man. This car's got guts.
- Sort of like you that way. - Whose car is this, Max?
Chastity told you to shut up and sit tight and things would be fine.
- You did that. It tells me a lot. - Everything's not fine.
We're in a stolen car, a cop is dead.
Calm down, man. He'd been snoopin' around. He had to go.
What do you mean, "He had to go"? What happened out there?
You gotta learn not to ask so many questions.
Slow the hell down, man! You're freakin' me out!
You ain't seen nothin' yet.
- Max, look out!
I'm gonna make you one of us.
But I call the shots. Always remember that.
Hey, Chuck.
Sorry to make you trek over here for what's probably a glitch.
- What'd you come up with? - Nothing but eye strain at first.
Then I ran it through my imaging software.
I'm here to tell you, it's not a glitch. It's what the camera saw.
Yes and no. Initially, I was thinking spectral manifestation.
But with spirit activity, you'd expect to see light streaks, auras,
atmospheric disturbances, translucent figures.
Whatever this is, it's not a ghost.
That's what the gunk on the floor turned out to be.
Huh. I dig a mystery with layers.
Chuck, I get the feeling you don't know what the hell this is.
I cross-referenced the shape's silhouette...
The closest match was a Soviet Akula class submarine.
I think we can rule that out.
And then there's this weirdness.
around the anomaly.
- A shadow. - It fit with the lighting in the room.
Which is impossible because it only appears for a single frame.
One-thirtieth of a second.
You know what? Maybe, uh, SCAG can give us a clearer picture.
I'm beta testing it forJ.P.L.
It's still in the tweaking phase, but the basic idea is...
I assign known color values...
onto the black-and-white image.
Then SCAG assigns chromatic values throughout the frame,
in effect making an educated guess at, uh,
what all the colors might be.
It still needs fine tuning.
What?
You recognize these colors, Scully?
I'm not. I heard you took a ride.
What was that? How did he do it?
You'll find out.
Maybe you were right... about me not bein' cut out for this.
It's a little late for second thoughts.
You tryin' to move in on my girl?
- Saved by the bell.
Hey, you wanna stare at someone? Stare at me.
Well, class.
I graded your midterms.
Save for a few of you, the news is not good.
Mr. Pembleton.
What happened?
Welcome back, Mr. Reed.
Expect to make up the test tomorrow.
Mr. Harden, you're here on time for a change.
What's this?
- Self-explanatory, isn't it? - I got every answer right.
- Not because you knew the material. - You sayin' I cheated? How?
I have no idea how.
But you did. And I won't tolerate it.
Back to business, people.
- Mr. Guider?
How do I tell Max that I want out?
I wish I could help you, Tony.
I can't even help myself.
Babbit!
Oh, my God!
Excuse me, please. Thank you.
Just stay back.
I'll show you my theory if you show me yours.
Based on the eyewitness accounts of the students I spoke to,
at this moment I'd have to say that I don't have one.
What about for these globs of goo?
- The ones we found in the evidence room? - Yeah.
I'm guessing Max Harden could tell us how they got there.
You think Max did this? Based on what?
because he failed him on his midterm exam, so he had motive.
Well, he may have had motive, but he didn't have opportunity.
There was nobody here who saw him even go near the victim.
Maybe he didn't need to. I pulled his records.
As his behavior was getting worse, his grades were going through the roof.
His body and his brain chemistry is in a state of unparalleled upheaval,
plus there's peer pressure and-and substance abuse.
Any one of these factors could alter his behavior radically.
What if it's given him a kind of psychokinetic or paranormal ability...
- That's your theory? - Yes, it is.
Soon to be proven as soon as I get Max in for questioning.
- I want to talk to him about his son. - He's with him now.
You hear about Max? Is he okay?
What, no candy, no flowers?
My deputy told me you were comin'and why.
Sheriff, we'd like to ask your son a few questions, if that's okay.
The boy's sick. The doctors can't even say what's wrong with him.
Max could tell them. You know why you collapsed, don't you, Max?
Yeah. Too much teen spirit.
You think? Smells like murder to me.
Who do you think you're talkin'to here?
Yeah, it's not like you got a damned thing on me.
You got a problem with authority figures, don't you, Max?
If I wasted Babbit, then how did I do it? Am I like Carrie or somethin'?
I used some kind of mental powers?
Came in handy with Babbit and Deputy Foster.
Man, you're whistlin' "Dixie."
High temperature and heart rate.
Low blood sugar. Electrolytes show acidosis.
All these symptoms are consistent with extreme exertion and withdrawal.
Withdrawal? From what?
and turn a flashlight into a battering ram also gives you quite a buzz.
Well, if I can do all that, what's stoppin' me from doin' it to you?
I don't know.
Maybe the effect's worn off.
Maybe you need another fix.
As soon as I blow out of here, I'll be sure to get one.
That's not gonna happen any time soon.
Your condition's getting worse.
And we're not gonna be able to help you unless you can tell us what's going on.
Boy, is any of this true?
- No. - You better pray I don't find out it is.
Sir? Can we have a word outside?
He's not a bad kid. He just needs discipline.
If your son is in trouble, I'm sure you'd want to know about it.
With that in mind, we'd like permission to search your house.
You're not getting it.
I'm not ready to jump on a bandwagon and call my boy a murderer.
There's some, uh, test results missing from Max's chart.
I think we should track 'em down.
Thanks.
Hot off the presses.
Anything interesting?
- This can't be right. - What is it?
Oh, my God.
What?
Evidence of cerebral lesions from repeated concussions.
Arthritis in the spine and major joints.
Stress fractures.
Numerous muscle and...
- And ligament micro-tears. - What would cause this?
In a teenager? I can't even imagine.
This is the kind of thing that you'd see in someone who's crashed race cars...
or played pro football for 15 years.
Whatever Max is doing, it's killing him.
I think I'm starting to get it.
Max Harden's personal effects.
Yeah.
This is it. Those globs we found...
this is where they came from.
Speed, Scully. Somehow Max Harden has found a way...
- To move faster than the eye can see. - Mulder.
appeared to move on their own with enough force to penetrate a wall.
Force equals mass times acceleration. Isn't that right?
Yes, but it's impossible. The human body isn't designed to move like that.
Exactly. That is... That is why his is falling apart.
Agents, could you...
Max... Max, please don't do this. You can stop.
Sure. Just like you can.
I mean hurting people. Haven't enough people already been hurt?
This is not why I got you out!
- Let's leave here. Let's just go away. - And do what?
Find a place to get some help.
Help for what? This is the best thing that's ever happened to me.
I can't go back to things standin' still.
And neither can you.
Tony, what are you doing here?
You went in that cave, didn't you?
You shouldn't have done that.
It was such a rush... moving fast like that.
I didn't want this for you. How did you find it?
I followed you. I was worried about you.
That's so sweet.
I wish things were different than how they are.
Maybe they can be. With Max in the hospital, we could go to the cops.
He's out.
Oh, my God.
Hello?
Boo.
You killed Ron Foster.
Yeah, I did.
Why?
I don't know. You want some great reason?
You little son of a bitch!
He thought he was really somethin'.
Always liked to push people around.
Same as Babbit... and same as you.
I'm not afraid of you anymore.
I can't let you do this, Max.
- Take him to O.R. one. - All right.
Yo, Scully.
How bad are his injuries?
It's too soon to tell. He's unconscious and bleeding internally,
apparently from a blow to the abdomen.
Yeah, delivered with this. Max's weapon of choice against cops.
Why would he leave it behind? Do you think he's doing it to taunt the police?
No, I think somebody intervened.
I think that's why the sheriff is still alive and why his gun is missing.
But if he can do what you claim, then... then who could possibly intervene?
The someone who knows exactly how Max does what he does.
And someone who's finally standing up to him.
Tony. How do we find him?
Well, I would guess the source where Max gets his power from.
The woods near where the deputy was killed.
Tony never came clean about what he was doing out there.
Well, maybe that's why the deputy was killed.
Maybe he got too close to the truth.
Chastity, we don't have to be doing this.
I told you, I took care of things with Max.
No, you didn't, and you shouldn't have tried.
He was slowing down. Tony, you've slowed down too.
If we don't get back to the cave before Max does, we're history.
- Hurry! - I'll catch up.
Chastity?
Are you okay?
You're late, kid.
- What did you do to her? - She took a swing at me.
You believe that? You got it all turned around.
Come on, man.
Who do you think you're dealin' with?
All I ever wanted was you to be my friend, Tony.
You stuck a knife in my back.
And now I'm gonna mess you up.
I'm sorry, Tony.
I can't go back.
Chastity?
Did the U.S.G.S. show up?
- And what'd they come up with? - Nothing.
A little bat guano and above normal magnetic field readings,
but nothing that would cause a physiological effect.
- What'd you expect them to find, Mulder? - I don't know.
A vortex like the one in Oregon.
Gravitational aberrations, unique chemical compositions,
relics that would indicate the cave was a sacred site.
Something. Anything. I don't know.
What if we're too old?
You said teenagers differ...
from adults chemically and physiologically.
What if whatever's in that cave effects only them?
Well, that's doubtful.
But no more so than any other theory.
I mean, it's worth checking out.
Yeah? Well, we can't.
As of an hour ago, they pumped concrete into the cave,
sealed it for precautionary reasons.
We'll never know.
How's he doin'?
Bruises and muscle strains mostly.
He'll recover. Go back to being a normal kid.

Three.
Give me two.
Two.
Can I have five cards, please?
Five? What, are you serious?
Four's the limit. Let's see your ace.
If Mr. Weems wants five,
give him five.
Dealer takes two.
Four.
Nah.
- How much is that? -  Four grand keeps you in...
you and your five shiny new cards.
There's 4,000.
And four more.
Let's make this interesting.
I'm raising you 15 large.
I wouldn't do that. This is all I need.
You're gonna need Depends... after you see this hand.
Now we show each other our cards?
Four kings.
That's a straight flush, right?
Beginner's luck.
No, no. Not so fast.
We expect a chance to win some of our money back.
Guys, there's over a hundred thousand dollars here.
You're damn right there's over a hundred thousand dollars there.
A hundred thousand's all I need.
Sorry.
I had fun, though.
Where can I cash out?
Guys, I think we're going up instead of down.
Guys?
Guys, this is not what I meant by "cashing out." Hey!
Hey!
-  Hello?
Mulder, it's me. What now?
- Are you in Chicago? - Yes, I'm in Chicago.
I'm on the northeast corner of Seventh and Hunter just like you asked.
Only you're not here. So where are you?
Oh, around.
- Yeah? - Hey, nice outfit.
Hey.
What's down there?
Before you check out down there, check out up there.
The top two floors are leased to oneJimmy Catrona,
- Whose name you might be familiar with. - Organized crime.
Gambling, extortion, murder.
They witnessed a man being thrown from Catrona's roof at 10:40 p.m.
This man fell 30 floors, plus the distance down this shaft...
because these doors just happened to be open, straight through, nothing but net.
- Ouch. - I'm guessing that's what he said...
after he got up, climbed out of here and scampered off into the night.
He got away. The agents gave chase, but no clear description.
- Was this basement thoroughly searched? - No.
Technically, falling 300 feet and surviving isn't a crime.
And your theory is?
What if this man had some kind of special capability...
some kind of genetic predisposition towards...
rapid healing or tissue regeneration?
So basically, what we if were looking for Wile E. Coyote?
You're saying that he's invulnerable.
- Right? - Yeah.
Then he walked away with a broken rib.
- What's your point? - My point is that if there's...
a wind gust or a sudden updraft,
and plus if he landed in exactly the right way...
I mean, I don't know. Maybe he just got lucky.
What if he got really, really lucky?
That's your big scientific explanation, Scully?
I mean, how many thousands of variables would have to convene...
No. Thousands.
- Mulder? - Yeah?
Look at this.
If this cart were on the platform when he hit, that would explain the wheels.
And what if this whole thing had just enough give to save his life?
- We'd have to find him to ask. - Yeah, we'd have to find him.
Looks like maybe we found part of him already.
I think you're taking a flier here, Mulder.
Maybe he can't see his way to the door.
Come on, Scully. I'm feeling lucky.
Can you help me? It's an emergency.
- Ma'am, we're not plumbers. - I didn't say you were.
I just want the damn water turned off so I can go to work.
You gotta be stronger than me, right? Valve's under the sink.
Your building super Henry Weems, he isn't around?
Mr. Dependable? Might as well wait forJimmy Hoffa to show up.
You're turning it the wrong way.
- Hey, Richie, sweetheart, back in bed. - But, Mom...
Butts are for sitting, and I want yours back in bed.
He's right. Clockwise.
I know that.
Clockwise.
You okay, Mulder?
Yeah, it's all right. My ass broke the fall.
Guess who I found.
Henry Weems, I presume?
Next time leave the plumbing to a professional.
Oh, uh...
Oh, uh, you wanna try this on for size, Cinderella?
Mr. Weems, why were you hiding in a vacant apartment?
Not hiding. Avoiding.
- Avoiding whom? - You people.
Now that you found me, let's just get it over with.
No way am I testifying againstJimmy Catrona.
Last night, Catrona had you thrown off the roof of 1107 Hunter Avenue.
- Is that correct? - You didn't hear it from me.
I'm not letting you people move me to Muncie, Indiana to milk cows.
More to the point, you survived a 300-foot fall,
- Essentially unharmed.
I don't know. Maybe the wind was just right.
And I landed on a bunch of towels. No biggie.
- You got lucky? - Yeah, I guess.
Except you should look at my bruise.
Plus, I didn't get to keep my poker winnings.
So, that's what you were doing there last night, playing poker?
Catrona thought I was cheating. I wasn't.
But like I said, you didn't hear it from me.
Must've been a high-stakes game, I imagine. Did you win a lot of money?
I don't know.
A little.
What is that? Did you make it?
Uh-huh.
- It's sort of a hobby. - Mm-hmm.
Mind if I...
- Ah. That's craftsmanship. - Wow.
- What does it mean? - What do you mean what does it mean?
- What's... - It doesn't mean anything.
I just sort of... I don't know.
It's cause and effect.
- So, are... are we done here? -  Mr. Weems?
Can I ask you to reconsider testifying against Catrona?
- Nope. No way, Jose. - It would be in your best interest.
He's tried to kill you once, and he will undoubtedly do it again.
- Yeah, we can protect you. - I'll take my chances.
So, here's the plan as I see it.
We inform the Chicago field office about Weems,
leaving it to them to secure his testimony.
You change your clothes,
we fly back to D.C. by sunset and all is right with the world.
Come on, Scully. Are you gonna dump this case just as it's getting interesting?
Interesting, Mulder, was when we were looking for Wile E. Coyote.
Come on, Mulder. This guy just got lucky. There's no X-File here.
Maybe his luck is the X-File.
Stairs.
Oh.
Car keys. Must have lost 'em when I fell.
So, you get many of these?
Okay.
So, uh, they searched the entire building,
and there's no sign of Henry Weems.
I'm guessing that he's on the run.
Our dead man's name is Angelo Bellini, a.k.a., Angie the Animal.
He's an enforcer for the Catrona family.
And I don't think his visit was friendly.
You think that Weems could have killed him in self-defense?
A skinny guy with no depth perception against a man nicknamed the Animal?
I don't think so. You and I both know Weems didn't kill anybody.
Besides, we were gone for two minutes. This guy doesn't have a scratch on him.
I'm thinking it was a heart attack.
What the hell happened here, Mulder?
Cause and effect.
- Meaning? - Okay, so watch.
So Bellini kicks down the door.
Poised to kill Weems, right? But just as he's about to pull the trigger,
a noise startles him.
The buzzer when I buzzed to be let back in the apartment.
So when he does pull the trigger, his aim is off.
Right? And he hits the lamp...
which falls over and knocks over the ironing board.
So as the bullet ricochets, Weems dives over the sofa.
Now when Bellini goes for him, he trips over the ironing board,
bounces off the chair, flips end-over-end...
and his shoelace gets caught in the fan... Q.E.D.
Cause and effect.
Seemingly unrelated and unconnected events and occurrences...
that appear unrelated and random beforehand,
but which seem to chain-react in Henry Weems' favor.
He won big at poker,
he survived getting thrown off a skyscraper, and now this.
- Hang on a second. - Okay.
Hey, your name's Richie, right?
- Yeah. - I'm Dana.
I'm sure that's what your mom would want.
So, I'm guessing you're a sports fan.
Which one's your favorite?
Well, it used to be basketball,
but now the Bulls suck, so I think maybe baseball.
I like baseball too.
Did Henry make this for you?
- That's pretty neat. - Yeah.
He made it for me when I was in the hospital.
He said it's 'cause everything happens for a reason.
Only just sometimes it's hard for us to see.
You went to the hospital because of your liver?
It doesn't work so good.
- Police looking for Henry? - Yeah.
They just wanna talk to him.
Do you have any idea where he might have gone?
Mm-mm.
Since I got sick, he hardly ever goes out.
- The boy give you any leads? - He knows nothing.
- Mulder, as to your theory, - Mm-hmm?
why would the world's most supernaturally lucky man...
work as a building superintendent?
I mean, why doesn't he just run down to the Illinois State Lottery,
enter and, you know, he'd win automatically?
How you feelin', pal?
I'm okay.
The police are lookin' for you, though.
How come?
Uh, you know.
You do folks a favor, wire their joint for free cable...
Don't worry about it.
You gonna be okay by yourself for a while?
Where you goin'?
Somethin' I gotta do I've been puttin' off.
You get some rest.
That's it? You've got nothing else?
Okay, thank you.
Henry Weems has no police record, I assume.
He has no record of any kind, Mulder.
He doesn't earn enough in a year to file tax returns.
He has no savings account, no checking account, no insurance.
I mean, it's like he's intentionally stayed off the radar.
He's retired from the world.
Ever since December 1989.
That's when a commuter jet crashed into Lake Michigan...
carrying 21 passengers.
- There was one survivor. - Henry.
Yeah. That's how he lost his eye.
Snowy night, Christmas rush. He'd been bumped from three flights...
before they finally found a seat for him on that fateful plane.
- Guess what seat number. - Thirteen?
- Of flight seven. - More good luck you're saying?
Call it good or bad, but maybe that's where it all started.
What if a brand-new Henry Weems was plucked from the wreckage...
one whose fortunes had been irrevocably permanently changed?
Before 1989, Henry held down a job for nine years at a train yard.
He severed ties with all his friends and moved out to Melrose Park.
Mulder, there are millions of reasons for that, including survivor's guilt.
What doesn't track for me is why Henry Weems would drop off the map...
just because he suddenly became incredibly lucky.
What doesn't track for me is why he's resurfaced after all these years.
Why he suddenly decided to use his luck in this way.
Hey, what's the, uh, lottery up to?
- Twenty-eight million. - I don't need that much.
You don't need that much? How much do you need, uh, Rockefeller?
More like a hundred grand.
Here goes. One dollar.
These suck.
More on this morning's Melrose Park shooting.
Let's go live to the scene with Megan MacLean.
Police have confirmed that a Melrose Park building superintendent...
is wanted for questioning in a case some sources term...
an unusually vicious gangland slaying.
You did it! You won a hundred grand!
- Where do I collect the money? - Man, they'll mail it to ya.
Eighty-two hundred dollars a month for twelve months. Yeah!
That's too long.
No, please, I wouldn't do that.
Oh, baby! Oh, sweet baby!
Anything in the trash can is the store's property.
- Yeah, right. In your face! - Please, no, just throw it away.
Something bad is gonna happen.
So long, suckers.
I did it! I won! I won the lottery!
A hundred grand, fools! A hundred grand!
On three. One, two, three.
So, let me get this straight.
And once you and he ascertained that the accident victim was still alive,
this man fled on foot?
- Mm-hmm. - Okay.
After which, the man who was hit by the truck...
handed you the lottery card and said...
"Maurice, I want you to have this."
Mm-hmm.
Thank you, Mr. Albert. I think that will be all.
Thank you.
Maybe that's part of the package. You can't have one without the other.
So, Mulder, Henry Weems came here to buy a lottery ticket.
Why?
Actually, that's exactly what you said...
about an hour after you said it.
Well, he's not in his place and he's not with Richie.
You think he hid in there?
He doesn't hide. He avoids.
Well, pretty damn well, I'd say.
That thing must go all over the building, Mulder.
I'll start with the roof if you wanna start with the basement.
Hey! Hey!
Watch the rough stuff.
Oh? You and I are gonna have a talk.
Oh, crap. Not again.
Let's get him up to O.R. Coming through.
Excuse us.
Does it hurt?
Stings a bit.
But I'll live.
Come over here, Henry. I wanna try something.
- What's that about? - I haven't a clue.
Nine of clubs. You go.
- What for? - I think you know.
Oh, you win.
Double or nothing.
Ooo-hoo! Tough to beat.
- You win again! - Mulder, what does that prove?
I think it proves if we played this 10,000 times in a row,
he would win 10,000 times in a row.
He's incapable of losing.
How does it feel to be the luckiest man in the universe, Henry?
It's a nightmare. You have no idea.
No, I do.
'Cause when you get lucky... really, really lucky...
people around you tend to suffer, is that right?
I think it's a balance thing.
Something good happens to me,
then everybody else has to take it in the keister.
So you stayed close to home mostly, kept a low profile.
But recently you've been venturing out further. You played poker with mobsters.
I figured they could stand the trimming.
Bunch of goombah jerks. They got issues, man.
You don't mind so much if a few criminals get hurt,
but then you went and you played the lottery.
- I don't... - I knew I shouldn't have done that.
- I needed the money. - For what?
For Richie, right?
It's the complications from his hepatitis.
He's on every donor list they got, but...
he's got a rare blood type... "B" negative.
And he's... C.N. something.
C.M.V. negative... Cytomegalovirus.
There's no way they're gonna find a donor in time.
There's a treatment program in England.
Hundred grand gets him in.
It's experimental, but... it's the best chance he's got now.
- Am I under arrest? - No.
However, you will need protection from Catrona and his men.
I'd say they need protection from me.
I'm sorry, Mulder. That was utterly irresponsible.
You're supposed to be talking him into protective custody, not out of it.
I'd agree with you if I thought his life was in danger.
As it is, he's doing a betterjob on Catrona's organization than the F.B.I.
I'm wondering if we shouldn't make him an honorary agent.
Mulder, you're putting an astounding amount of faith...
in coincidence and luck.
Essentially, you're betting a man's life on it.
And even if you believe in so-called lucky streaks,
you have to know they all eventually end.
Luckiest man in the world?
Well, Mulder, I just beat him.
- Mulder? - Come on, Scully.
Henry!
- You're supposed to be resting. - I am resting.
Playing on the floor doesn't count.
Don't you ever get tired of this thing?
Henry said it's educational.
Yeah, well, I don't want you believing everything that Henry says.
Did you know the police are looking for him?
- Henry said it's no big deal. - When did you see...
Mom, what's wrong?
How's he doin'?
He's got a bruised rib and a black eye.
It certainly could have been worse. And don't tell me he just got lucky.
Far from it.
Maybe what you said about streaks is right.
Looks like his has just about run its course.
I don't mean to make light of his misfortune,
but it may have knocked some sense into his head.
He's agreed to testify against Catrona.
They're filing a federal warrant this afternoon.
He was. I don't know what it is.
Maybe he has some special ability.
He's impervious or something.
Anyway, we can't get to him. They got cops all over the hospital.
Who says we have to get to him?
I want the toy Henry made me, Mom.
Can you please go get it?
Uh, sure, honey.
I will meet you at the hospital, okay?
- Did you find her? - No.
You know Catrona took her. He did it to keep me from testifying.
- We'll get one, though. - When?
Tomorrow? Next week?
Could someone sit with him at least?
Hold up, Henry. What if what I said before wasn't true?
That your luck hasn't changed? Maybe all this is happening for a reason.
So you're saying that Maggie getting taken is a good thing?
No, I'm saying that what looks like it might be bad luck may not be bad luck.
That we can't tell yet. We're not in that position.
We can't see the forest for the trees.
How is he?
Not good. If we don't find a donor in the next few hours...
Scully, what if everybody that becomes involved in Henry Weems' life...
somehow becomes an integral part of his luck, including you and I?
Mulder, you're speaking as if we're all trapped...
in one of those contraptions that he built.
- What are you doing? - Looking for Maggie Lupone.
Luck is the overreaching force in this investigation.
I say we roll with it.
- Yeah. Let's call that a dry run. - Yeah.
Look who came calling.
I wanted to tell you personally that there's no hard feelings.
I'm not testifying against you.
Just let Maggie Lupone go.
Maggie?
I don't know anybody named Maggie.
You know anybody named Maggie?
Fellas, don't jerk me around.
Jerk you around?
You tried to cheat me out of a hundred large,
you kill Angie, you put Sal in the hospital.
I'm jerkin' you around?
I apologize for my choice of words.
Please, just let her go.
Her kid's really sick.
I don't care what happens to me.
You'll care.
By the time I'm finished,
you'll definitely care.
Henry?
Richie, how is he?
Not that one.
Use the small one.
Hey!
Henry?
Don't you hurt him, you son of a bitch!
Shut her up!
Henry!
Oh!
Check downstairs!
What are the odds for Catrona being a perfect match?
- A thousand to one? A million to one? - Maybe higher.
Maybe everything does happen for a reason.
Whether we see it or not.
Maybe your luck is changing.
Maybe.

Mr. Maleeni.
Hey, guy. You ready to rumble?
If by "rumble" you mean perform, yes, I am.
Cool. You know how he said you get 125 for the day?
It's gonna be 75 instead. The gate's for crap.
But, hey, the show's gotta go on, right?
- This will be my greatest show ever. - Right on.
Ladies and gentlemen, damas y caballeros,
I aim today not just to entertain but to educate,
to instruct and inform in the venerable...
- And ancient history of my art.
UntilJohann Nepomuk Hofsinzer...
called playing cards the poetry of magic,
a conjuror's skill was determined entirely by his ability...
to perform one effect.
That effect was known as the cups and balls.
The games were known for hundreds, if not thousands of years.
Perhaps the greatest performer was the Italian Bartolomeo Bosco.
Get on with it.
Bosco's passes with the cups and balls.
Wah-day...
chubio...
colerader.
Three gone...
and yet three... return.
Bosco had only one contemporary rival,
a slightly older Frenchman named Conus, who announced in 1795...
Practice though I have, I have been unable even to get married.
Conus placed one ball in his pocket.
He put the second ball away.
Putting the third ball in his hand, he made it vanish,
and that's the mystery...
of the cups and the balls.
Yo! Can't you do anything that ain't a hundred years old?
That ain't old school, that's decrepit.
Young man, shall I come heckle you on your job?
Make sure you count out the requisite number of McNuggets?
Show me somethin'.
Come on. Show me somethin'.
A callow challenge to be met by experience and skill.
To wit, the Egyptian Dedi,
whose most celebrated feat...
was to reattach a recently severed head,
reuniting it with the still-warm body...
and no harm done.
Western history knows...
three previous attempts at recreating...
this Noachian feat,
each of the three ending in tragedy.
This will be the fourth.
May I have complete silence, please?
- Yeah!
Senor Maleeni! Ho ho!
Folks, let's give it up for the Amazing Maleeni.
Guy, you rock. That kicked ass. I mean, it looked completely real.
How did you do that?
Oh, yeah, right. Magic.
Oh, hey, your money. Hold up.
Two, four, fifty, fifty-five, sixty, sixty-five, seventy, seventy-five.
You earned it. Mr. Maleeni?
Mr. Maleeni.
Oh, God! Oh...
Whew.
- Neat trick, huh? - I can think of a neater one...
Come on, Scully. This isn't intriguing enough for you?
A magician turns his head completely around, 360 degrees,
to the delight of young and old alike,
after which it plops unceremoniously onto the pier.
- See the picture? - Yeah, I saw the picture.
And as for this Amazing Maleeni turning his head all the way around...
Like you said, Mulder, neat trick.
- But? - But... I'd guess this event...
was completely removed from his subsequent murder.
- You think this was a murder? - Don't you?
Mulder, his head was cut off.
Ah. Observe the nearly complete absence of blood.
- Of lycopodium powder. - Why are you talking like Tony Randall?
Know that the Amazing Maleeni was alive one moment and expired the next.
Mulder, I admit that I don't know how it happened,
but I still say that it was a murder.
- So what's your theory? - A magic trick gone horribly wrong.
One that claims the lives of all who attempt it.
Can I see that camcorder again?
Thank you.
A tourist videotaped...
Maleeni's performance.
This...
That ain't old school, that's decrepit.
-  Show me somethin'. - Who's the heckler?
Come on. Show me somethin'.
I don't know.
Neat trick, huh?
Hang on a second. Let me see this.
That heckler's pretty hard to impress, wouldn't you say?
Look at him. He just takes off in a huff.
I don't know. That'd be a neat trick in itself. You never see his face.
Ah! But observe.
His discarded soda cup.
The hand may be quicker than the eye, but it still leaves fingerprints.
- Provided they haven't dumped the trash. - Skeptic.
Mr. LaBonge?
We're agents Mulder and Scully from the F.B.I.
Were you at the Santa Monica Pier yesterday morning?
Yeah.
You attended a magic show, the Amazing Maleeni?
Yeah, he sucks. Why?
He's dead, under extremely suspicious circumstances.
He still sucks.
- How'd you find me? - Your fingerprints.
- You have a criminal record. - A conviction for pickpocketing.
Man, that was performance art. Besides, it's ancient history.
What are you saying? You think I killed him?
Well, you're on videotape heckling the deceased.
What did you have against Mr. Maleeni?
First of all, his name's not Maleeni.
That's the name of a real magician,
a guy at the turn of the century, Max Malini.
- Ever hear of him? - No.
It's too bad. You should've.
Anyway, he steals his name, spells it a little differently...
What about the trick where he turns his head completely around?
Check it out.
No problem. Did you like that?
- Yeah. - Watch.
A coin in the hand... blows away.
Maybe it's a little bit hard for you to see.
Let me make that... bigger for you.
Mozart and Salieri.
They sound pretty much the same to a layman.
But they ain't. You know what I'm sayin'?
It's about originality.
Style.
And more than anything else...
soul.
Because that's what separates the great ones...
from the hacks.
We can't do this halfway. We're dealing with powerful forces at work here.
Energies far beyond our mere...
mortal... understanding.
Enough to make a magician lose his head?
Could be.
That, and I hear Maleeni racked up some pretty big gambling debts.
Who knows who he might've pissed off.
Thank you, Mr. LaBonge. We'll, uh, be in touch.
Please do. Oh, and agents?
Mozart and Salieri. Which one's which?
Mulder, I think that professional jealousy...
is as good a motive for murder as any.
If it was a murder. I'm not convinced.
If I can get Mr. Maleeni into an autopsy bay,
hopefully we can put this issue to rest as soon as possible.
All right, I'm stumped. I think I'm supposed to be.
- What do you think? - Well, first of all,
I'm sorry to disappoint you, but Mr. Maleeni's head...
didn't just magically fall off.
It was very carefully sawed.
Very slow and exacting work,
probably with a fine-tooth meat saw.
And check out this little detail.
Spirit gum, Mulder.
It held the head to the body.
- Just barely, of course. - So he was murdered?
Well, no. As far as I can tell, this man died of advanced coronary disease.
- Natural causes. - Yeah.
and then glued it back on all in the space of 30 seconds.
- Does that make sense to you? - No.
Which makes it even stranger still,
because as far as I can tell...
this body has been dead for over a month.
I see signs of refrigeration.
And yet he performed yesterday.
- What a trouper. - Well, somebody performed yesterday.
Cissy Alvarez.
Who are you?
You don't remember me. Ain't that a bitch?
My name's LaBonge. I did time with you about eight years ago.
I hear you're a poker player.
You won big off a guy who calls himself the Amazing Maleeni.
Also goes by the name of Herman Pinchbeck.
- Pinchbeck? - He's dead.
Yeah, I saw in the paper.
Something about his head fell off. Yeah. What's it to you?
I'm the guy that made his head fall off.
You took his marker, right? What'd he owe you, 15 grand?
You want to cut to the chase?
You know, get a little more of your story out before we stomp you to death?
How would you like to get back what you're owed times ten?
200,000. Mm. How?
- Helping me. - Do what?
Magic.
Wanna hear more?
Excuse me. I'm looking for Mr. Albert Pinchbeck.
- He look familiar to you, Scully? - He certainly does.
- The plot thickens. - He might try and run.
Come in.
- Good morning, Mr. And Mrs... - Agents Mulder and Scully, F.B.I.
You're not here for a home loan, I take it.
No. We are investigating the death of a magician...
who called himself the Amazing Maleeni.
Herman Pinchbeck, my twin brother.
Yes, we know. We checked his next of kin.
Car accident.
So your injured neck has nothing to do with a magic trick...
you performed at the Santa Monica Pier two days ago,
one which involved you turning your head around 360 degrees?
Well, no. That wasn't me.
I was in a bad car accident in Mexico.
A bad Mexican car accident in Mexico.
- Do you know magic, Mr. Pinchbeck? - Yes, I do.
Back in the '70s, my brother and I performed together.
- Why'd you stop? - You never really stop.
Pick a card, any card?
Hmm.
- Very impressive. - My brother and I both wanted to do...
the absolute best magic the world had ever seen.
The difference was, I knew we'd never get there,
but he always believed we would.
We didn't talk much after I quit the act.
I have a theory, Mr. Pinchbeck, and I'm gonna tell you how it goes.
I think that your brother Herman died of heart disease...
having never made it as the world's greatest magician.
I think that hurt you, just as your estrangement from him hurt you.
I think what you did was perform his last act for him.
One last act for which he'd always be remembered.
One last act that would end with such a shock, such a denouement,
as would be forever remembered in the annals of magic.
That's what I think.
I so wish that were true.
It was a very bad car accident in Mexico.
- Oy! - No kidding.
What now?
A guy's head falls off, it's the greatest trick in the world.
When there's no discernible point to it,
what's the reason for doing that in the first place?
Well, why do people do magic? To impress, to delight, to gain attention.
Well, this one's gaining mostly police attention.
Maybe that's the point.
Well, maybe we should consult an expert...
someone who knows magic, who's seen the greatest trick in the world.
Maybe he can help us figure that out.
- Mozart. - Yeah.
What's in it for me?
I mean, let's say I help you out. What do I get in return?
The feeling of pride that comes from performing your civic duty?
How 'bout the chance...
to root through the professional secrets of your least favorite magician?
Good for a laugh, I guess.
Man, it's worse than I thought.
You gotta feed those things, you know.
So...
- Maleeni wasn't murdered. - It would seem not.
So someone impersonated him and his crappy act.
It's impressive.
I'd say the twin brother did it, but I don't think...
he's any better a magician than Maleeni was.
There's that, and he's got no legs.
Yeah. Whatever.
Yeah. Whatever.
Anyway, we're looking for a magician with the same height and build.
A good makeup job and the right wig, and no one would know the difference.
Not even you, I guess.
I had a couple of Jell-O shots in me.
Hey, how did this impersonator switch out the dead body?
Because magic is all about... misdirection.
Your impersonator simply made sure everyone was looking the other way...
when he pulled Maleeni's body from its secret hiding place...
underneath...
the floor.
Man, this guy's good.
Well, thanks for your expert opinion.
I guess we're right back where we started.
Maybe not.
You said that, uh, the Amazing Maleeni had some gambling debts?
Yeah, that's what I heard.
Check this out. Looks like a marker.
$20,000. Pinchbeck.
What would this be doing in Maleeni's van?
Thank you, Mr. Pinchbeck.
If you could sign here for me.
With pleasure.
- Anthony, what kind of gun is that? - Glock 17,.9 millimeter.
I've been thinking of maybe buying one since my accident.
Well, here. Take a look.
Hmm.
- Gosh, it's heavier than I would've thought.
Thank you, Anthony, Marvin.
- If you ever want, I'll take you to the shooting range.
- Hmm. - Have a good one, Mr. Pinchbeck.
You too.
Hello, may I help you?
- Damn, you look just like him. - I'm sorry?
Your no-good, malapaga brother...
died owing me money...
a lot of money.
- You're gonna make good. - I'm sorry,
but my, uh, brother's debts are his own.
I said, you're gonna make good,
'cause me and my friends, we know where you live.
- That sound like the rear diff? - Pull over.
Stay here and call it in. I'll check it out.
We got a problem with the rear diff. We're on Fourth and Main.
Checking it out is Anthony.
You! In the truck! Get up where I can see you.
Hands where I can see them!
Up! Hands up.
All right. Get out.
Mister, get out...
Hey, I got a guy down back here!
It was a guy with tattoos! I shot him four times!
I don't understand. He was right here.
It's your handwriting, is it not?
Mr. Alvarez, please answer the question.
That ain't mine. I don't know where you got that.
It's interesting. Yours are the only fingerprints on it.
We ran it through the California Criminal History Database,
to which you seem to be quite well known.
So it's my marker.
So Pinchbeck owed me money. It was a friendly game of poker.
Very friendly. $20,000 friendly.
- Where did you find that? - In Herman Pinchbeck's van.
Where were you last Thursday?
Here. All day. Ask 'em.
What is it you think I did to Pinchbeck, huh?
What's in it for me? If I kill him, he ain't gonna pay me.
I didn't know what he was.
And he sure as hell couldn't play worth a damn.
Don't leave town, Mr. Alvarez.
Don't you find it odd that the Amazing Maleeni's a lousy poker player?
Behold... an ordinary household quarter.
- Where is it? - It's in your right hand.
No, no, no. Ahh-ahh!
- That's not bad. Mulder... - Blow your nose, Scully.
- Blow your nose. Come on. Blow. - Achoo.
I made you look in one direction, the quarter went in the other.
That's what you think's happening in this case?
I think we're being led around by our noses.
- By whom? Maleeni's already dead. - It certainly would appear so.
But then again, you thought the quarter was in the right hand.
911 emergency. - Yeah, hello?
Yeah, I want to report a man with a gun. He's threatening to kill somebody.
- Can you please speak up? - No, I can't speak up. No, I can't!
Sir?
Hello? Hello?
Son of a bitch.
Hey, partner. Hey, guys.
- You son of a bitch. - I'm sorry?
You tried to frame me.
- You're dead.
Freeze!
Drop your weapon.
Hands behind your head. Do it!
Put your hand down. Spread your legs.
Agents. An unexpected surprise.
- I'm fairly busy, actually. - I'll bet.
- Hey! What? - Let's take a little spin, shall we?
- What's this all about? - It's about misdirection, Mr. Pinchbeck.
Or should I say the Amazing Maleeni?
Mulder!
It's a trick, Scully. Voila.
Had you fooled.
- You're Maleeni? - Call me Herman.
I was afraid for my life.
That's why I did what I did. I'm not proud of that.
But I owe a lot of money that I can't possibly pay back.
We know... gambling debts to a man named Alvarez.
Yeah, that tattooed psychopath.
I've since heard terrible stories about him,
things he did in prison to fellow inmates.
- So why'd you play poker with him? - He runs a good game.
I gamble to supplement my income. God knows, magic barely pays.
Why did you lose? You could've manipulated the cards, right?
Cheat? You're asking why I don't cheat at cards?
- Well, you could, right? -  Of course, I could.
But how would I live with myself? Who raised you?
Well, sir,
what does any of this have to do with your twin brother...
being found decapitated at the Santa Monica Pier?
I went to my brother for a loan.
Just my luck and his.
You found him dead of a heart attack.
His body was still warm.
Looking at him lifeless,
I saw myself, my own eventual mortality.
I saw all the things I meant to accomplish but didn't.
It was an opportunity to vanish, to become someone else.
Like I said, I'm not proud of what I did.
And so you refrigerated the body.
I needed time to figure out how to pull it all off.
Impersonating my brother, I called the bank,
told them I needed a vacation week,
a trip to Mexico.
Then the bank received word that I'd been in a terrible accident.
It gave me plenty of time away from work.
And you posed as an amputee...
to allay suspicion that you weren't your brother.
That, and I rather enjoy the sympathy,
especially from the women in our office.
You, uh, still haven't explained...
why you left your brother's body at the pier,
or why you arranged to have his head fall off.
He explained it. He put it so eloquently when we last spoke.
It was my final performance.
I wanted to go out with such a shock, such a denouement,
as would forever be remembered in the annals of magic.
That was your last performance.
What's this for?
Well... I still think you've got a few tricks up your sleeve.
My God.
We gave you handicapped parking. We built you a ramp.
Did he have access to the vaults?
Well, yes. He has a key to the day gate. Several of us do.
- What are you looking for, Mulder? - Any hint at all...
as to why Maleeni here is really impersonating his brother.
What about this? Could he have removed the funds electronically?
He didn't have security clearance for E.F.T. s... electronic fund transfers.
Maybe he got around the security. Can we check the withdrawal records?
It would require your badge number and thumbprint...
and probably a federal subpoena to boot.
We're extra cautious with the E.F. T.s. You can understand why.
There may be an easier way.
- If I call up a transaction list for this terminal...
No. No, everything's in order.
Mulder, it says here something about a robbery attempt yesterday.
Yeah, that wasn't against us, but the armored transport service we deal with.
No money was taken and no suspects were caught.
Yeah, well, Mr. Pinchbeck was the employee who signed out the truck.
- He knew the schedule. - I had nothing to do with that.
Maybe, maybe not.
We'll hold you till we find out.
Make sure you don't pull a vanishing act.
- Hey.
Paul, I'm putting Mr. Pinchbeck in six.
Right.
Sleep tight.
Wait. Don't I get a phone call, sir?
- Sir?
- How'd it go? - Swimmingly.
Abracadabra, man.
Oh, damn!
Yes. Okay.
- All right. All right, thank you. - Maleeni?
Certainly doesn't look like he did this.
Lots of fingerprints.
Yeah, I guarantee you, none of them match our thieves.
They're too clever to leave clues,
except for the ones they want us to find.
- Excuse me. May I show you something? - Hmm.
We thought the security-camera footage might show the robbers.
-  Does it? - No. They all mysteriously...
went blank from about 3:00 a.m. to 3:20,
Cissy Alvarez, convicted bank robber.
- You recognize this man? - Yeah. Who is he to you?
-  I know those tattoos.
That's the man who tried to rob my truck.
Aah! What the hell, man? What did I do?
Yo, F.B.I., what's up? What's up with this, man?
You can't just come bustin'in here! I got civil rights!
I'm gonna call my lawyer, and then we're gonna see what's what.
Yo, what are they lookin' for?
- Come on! Somebody talk to me! -  Shut up!
No, you shut up! Yo, man, this ain't right.
Why you got the cuffs on so tight?
Yo, will you please tell me what he's lookin'for?
Oh!
- What? - Well. Saving up for a rainy day?
- It was the magician! - The magician? Maleeni?
No, not the dead one, man! That little cabron LaBonge! LaBonge set me up!
- Listen to me! Listen to me! - Billy LaBonge.
And the Amazing Maleeni. That's a double bill I wouldn't want to miss.
Pinchbeck. You made your bail.
You, too, LaBonge.
-  Okay.
Good morning, gentlemen. Did you sleep well?
Agent Mulder. Agent Scully.
- Bravo. Really. - What do you mean?
Last night the Cradock Marine Bank was robbed of $1.8 million.
This morning that entire amount was found...
in the possession of Mr. Cissy Alvarez.
Wow. I told you he was bad news. Bravo to you.
- It was expeditious police work. -  Well, thank you.
It was, wasn't it? It's only that Alvarez was so obviously guilty...
a convicted bank robber caught red-handed,
witnessed trying to rob an armored car just two days earlier?
- He'll need a good lawyer. - Yeah.
I don't quite see where you're headed with this.
I have no evidence, but I have a theory, Mr. Maleeni,
and, uh, I'll tell you how it goes.
I think that your twin brother Albert died of a heart attack,
at which point, you and your young protegee saw a golden opportunity.
My protegee? I hate this guy's guts.
That's what you wanted us to think.
You wanted revenge against the man who made your life in prison a living hell.
I did time with you about eight years ago.
Alvarez. You and he were on the same cell block eight years ago.
Which gave LaBonge an in with Alvarez once everybody thought you were dead.
LaBonge planted Alvarez's marker in Maleeni's van and made sure we found it.
And then you used Alvarez's greed in order to ensnare him,
and then orchestrated the attempted bank robbery in order to implicate him.
Yeah, that was you in the armored car disguised as Alvarez.
Somehow Mr. Pinchbeck got ahold of the guard's gun and switched the clip.
And then last night, the two of you robbed the bank...
and planted the money at Alvarez's place.
Don't you think we have pretty good alibis?
You have great alibis. You have the best alibis in the world,
which is why I think you two got arrested in the first place.
With your expertise in sleight of hand, pickpocketing and escapology,
I think you were both able to get out of here by pilfering a guard's key.
You could have escaped, stolen the money, framed Alvarez...
and been back here in time for breakfast.
Scrambled eggs and sausage.
That would be the world's greatest trick, wouldn't it?
One that would be forever remembered in the annals of magic.
- What happens to us? -  To you?
You go free, provided the magic is over.
The great ones always know when to leave the stage.
Billy, let's get the hell outta here.
- They are the world's greatest. - We saw through their magic.
Ah, there's more.
Behold.
- The Amazing Maleeni's wallet. - You picked his pocket?
No, I pilfered it from the evidence room to prevent them from completing...
their final act of prestidigitation.
- What are you talking about? - I began to wonder,
why did they need so elaborate a setup?
We were the last piece of the puzzle.
Yes. Framing Alvarez was just another misdirection.
This trick was about E.F.T. s, electronic fund transfers at the bank.
Maleeni, Pinchbeck, he didn't have security clearance for them,
so he needed a little federal law enforcement intervention...
specifically, my badge number...
and my thumbprint.
as to make that 1.8 million look like cigar-lighting money.
But they can't do it without this.
Pick a card, Scully. Any card.
You know, Mulder, there's still one thing that you haven't explained.
What's that?
How the Amazing Maleeni was able to turn his head completely around.
- I don't know that. - I do.
I'll show you. Observe.
Gee! Very nice. How'd you do that?
Well... magic.
No, seriously, Scully. How'd you do it?
You know, it's not the same thing.
Uh, it's different with the head. Come on, now. Look at this.

Good afternoon. I hope we're not bothering you.
- I'm just waiting for a call. - We're all waiting, ma'am,
for the good Lord to call in his flock.
From the cable TV people.
I'm just moving in. God bless.
Good afternoon. I hope we're not bothering...
- Yes? - Y-You're...
- Weren't you... - Yeah, didn't we just...
- Didn't you just what? - Speak to you.
- What are you talking about?
Yeah, just down the street. She's just moving in. Your spitting image.
You're really not gonna believe it when you see her.
- Ma'am? - Go away! Get out of here!
Okay.
Betty Templeton?
- Yes? - We're with the F.B.I.
I just moved in yesterday. I don't know anything about any incident.
Well, we have two young men in the car who say you do know something.
Oh, my God!
Those were the boys that were here yesterday. What happened?
They were beaten to within an inch of their lives by each other...
after visiting the home of a woman living a few blocks over.
fits your description.
She, uh, lives around here?
Are you a practitioner of the occult, Miss Templeton?
Wicca, voodoo, Satanism, the black art of bodily bilocation?
Me? No.
You know what they say.
Everyone has a twin out there somewhere.
No, we don't know what they say.
We went over to the house, but it's empty. No one lives there.
Frankly, we're not even sure if she exists.
This is an F.B.I. fleet sedan...
driven into a tree at 43 miles an hour by the female agent...
in a novel effort to kill her male counterpart.
Now, you might think I'm gonna suggest psychokinesis, P. K...
someone or something controlling the agents with remote mind-bending power.
But it's not?
Both agents sustained critical injuries. Their stories eerily similar,
You may think that I'm gonna say it's past lives unresolved,
a fate stalking the agents like an animal.
- Seven years? - Yeah, but they are not...
romantically involved, if that's what you're thinking.
Not even I would be so farfetched.
You have any ideas, Scully? Any thoughts?
What I'm thinking, Mulder, is how familiar this seems.
Playing Watson to your Sherlock.
You dangling clues out in front of me one by one.
It's a game, and...
And as usual, you're holding something back from me.
You're not telling me something about this case.
Hmm?
Okay, so these agents were investigating something.
- Something much like...
what they themselves were almost killed by.
Uh, something they came into contact with.
Uh, third party.
Two third parties.
Twins?
Relatives?
Uh, doppelganger?
Uh, corporeal likeness...
that appears unbidden from the spirit world,
the sight of which presages one's own death.
Or... a double conjured into the world by a technique called bilocation,
which, in psychological terms,
represents the person's secret desires and impulses,
committing acts that a real person cannot commit himself...
or... herself.
Mulder, the slide, please.
Yes!
Don't go thinking I'm gonna start doing the autopsies.
Excuse me.
Hi. I applied for the sales job you posted.
Ah, yeah. I remember. How could I forget?
- As I recall, Miss... - Pfeiffer.
- Are you sure? - Lulu Pfeiffer, yes.
You reside at 15527 Morton Bay Street?
- Not any longer. I've moved. - You've moved?
Yes. And I don't have my new address yet.
Actually, Miss Pfeiffer, that's what's sending up the red flag.
You move a lot. And there's also your employment history.
Seventeen jobs in seventeen states in the past three years?
You seem to have as many jobs here as you have addresses.
I... I had a restless streak.
Well, the copy business takes a motivated person.
Oh, I'm an extremely versatile employee, as you can see by my resumé.
What I can tell is you've left a variety of jobs.
"Mongolian barbecue chef, high-rise window washer,
- Wild animal trainer, palm reader."
- Yes, but I am on a career path now. - Hey! What's going on here?
- Yes, but I am on a career path now. - Hey! What's going on here?
- All my copies are black. - My machine's going crazy.
Who's running this place?
I can start you immediately. There's a clean uniform in the employee washroom.
- Oh, God. - Here. Over here. Oh, that's great.
- Can you help me turn this thing off?
My only copy!
That's quite a string of positions you've had, Miss... Templeton.
Seventeen jobs in the last three years.
I would've listed more, but there wasn't any room left on your form.
Seventeen's plenty, believe me.
It's not your references. It's the jobs themselves.
"Mongolian barbecue chef, high-rise window washer.
Wild animal trainer?"
I'm a highly versatile employee.
What guarantee do I have that you won't just up and quit tomorrow?
You have my personal word on it. I'm here in Kansas City to stay.
- Who is it?
Mr. Zupanic, it's the F.B.I.
- Excuse me? - It's the F.B.I., Mr. Zupanic.
- Open up. - Give me a minute.
- Bert Zupanic? - Yeah?
We're hoping you could help us find the whereabouts...
of a woman we think you're familiar with...
a Betty Templeton.
I don't know no Betty Templeton.
Maybe you should take another look at that photograph, Mr. Zupanic.
Five foot three, red hair.
Maybe I can jog your memory.
Are you still pleading ignorance, Mr. Zupanic?
Is that not you in last year's Fourth ofJuly parade?
- Yeah. - Then who's that sitting next to you?
- Her. - Try Betty Templeton.
We can't find her, Mr. Zupanic. She seems to have left town in a hurry.
- She did? - Mm-hmm.
And didn't she used to live on Morton Bay in a pink house?
- Alderwood, blue house. - On Alderwood?
Mr. Zupanic, do you have any reason to be lying to us?
No, sir... I mean, ma'am.
Thank you, Mr. Zupanic. I have no doubt we'll be in touch with you.
and where we can find her, but that he is hip to whatever she's into,
and I should take a look at that house he mentioned on Morton Bay Street...
while you go and find out from Mr. Zupanic what it is exactly...
that he's clearly hiding about Betty Templeton.
I'm thinking that Bert Zupanic really truly doesn't know Betty Templeton.
Well, I guess that's why they put the "l" in the F.B.I.
I'm gonna be standin'on the corner
12th Street and Vine
I'm gonna be standin' on the corner
12th Street and Vine
Give me a double, Freddy.
I thought you were in training, Bert, my man.
- Would you just pour? - All right.
Well, I might take a train
I might take a plane but if I have to walk
I'm goin'just the same
I'm goin'to Kansas City
Kansas City, here I come
Nice outfit.
Freddy, fire in the hole.
Seven and Seven for the lady, and make it stiff.
Oh, my God! How did you do that?
- Do what? - How did you know my drink?
I feel like you're looking right through me,
like you're reading my soul like a book.
Maybe you've had enough of the vodka.
- You are in trouble, aren't you? - I don't know.
I could be.
What kind of trouble are you looking for?
You don't want to go home tonight, okay?
It just so happens I don't got a home to go to.
Anyway, I'm Betty Templeton.
Alderwood Avenue.
- My God.
I'm shaking.
Oh... Oh, that's perfect.
Hey.
Hey, Scully!
I want you to meet a buddy of mine, Mr. Argyle "Sapersteen."
- "Stein." - Saperstein. Excuse me.
- This is my partner, Dana Scully.
Pleasure and an honor.
So, uh, I take it from your posture, Mulder, you've solved this case.
Not solved it, but I have narrowed down the search for our perpetrator...
with the kind help of Mr. Saperstein here.
- Narrowed it down to where? - Right down there.
Our mystery woman is indeed involved with Mr. Bert Zupanic,
the man we spoke to at his hotel,
If it's the lady I'm thinking, she's not much to look at,
but he says she brings him luck.
- Bert Zupanic is a boxer? - A wrestler, semipro.
Well, there's lots to do here and the barbecue's second to none.
Right, Mr. Saperstein? Plus, Mr. Saperstein was gonna show me...
on the American pop culture, right?
Unless, of course, you've already found Betty Templeton.
Finding Betty Templeton won't solve this case, Mulder.
Not unless we find Lulu Pfeiffer.
- Who's Lulu Pfeiffer? - Our doppelganger...
who lived, until yesterday, in a pink house on Morton Bay Street.
But she's not a manifestation, Mulder. She's real...
and so is the path of destruction that she's left in her wake.
Though there seems to be no connection of any kind between these two women,
Betty Templeton and Lulu Pfeiffer...
have traveled city to city across 17 U.S. states,
one alternately trailing the other for the past 12 years.
It's not just car accidents and fistfights, Mulder.
- Sholom Aleichem. - Yeah. Your mama.
- Hello. - Where's my money?
I got it, and I'm bringing it.
Yeah, that's what I heard last night. Now you got the feds on your ass.
Maybe I should cancel the fight.
I'm bringing the money, okay? I'm bringing it!
I'm having lunch at Froggy's. No money, no fight, Titanic.
- In trouble or something? - I'm just, uh...
I gotta be somewhere, okay?
Why? What time is it? Oh, God, I'm gonna be late for work!
You were incredible.
Why do I find myself so wildly attracted to you, Bert Zupanic?
You just can't help yourself, baby.
Where were you last night?
- Where was I? - Yeah.
- Well, I... - You said, "Meet me for a drink."
- That's what you said.
I was there, and I-I was waiting on you.
- Who is she? - "Who is she?"
You do not wanna get in the ring with me, mister!
Honey, listen... Come on, baby. There's nobody under there.
- You're acting crazy, sweetie. - I'm gonna look under every single...
Hey! I know this hairpin.
Oh, I-I can explain that.
You lovable lug, Bert Zupanic!
I'm sorry, baby. This is mine.
- Of course it is. - I just get so jealous.
- You forgive me? - I forgive you.
- Will you call me at least? Bye. - You bet. I'm on the phone now, okay?
- Bert, did I hear voices?
- Voices? I didn't hear any voices.
Oh!
Oh.
Where's the Titanic?
What?
Your boyfriend, the wrestler.
Wow, talk about moves.
I can't believe that we barely just met.
He's supposed to meet me here.
He's coming here?
He'd better be if he wants that fight Saturday night.
I'd better go freshen up a little. I was just coming in for lunch.
Zupanic, hey.
Thought you were a no-show. Talking to your girlfriend.
- My girlfriend?
Holy shoot!
What is that?
- Now, how did she do that? - Do what?
I just saw her. I swear. I just saw her go to the can.
- She just went to the can? - Ten seconds ago.
- What are you doing here? - I have a business meeting.
Why don't I meet you outside in the park?
- I was just gonna get some lunch. - Perfect.
- We'll have a picnic. - A picnic? We never do that.
- Oh, yeah.
Now...
- Bert?
I have a little business to attend to, sweetie.
- You got more than that to attend to. - Hey, Bert, I only got an hou...
Mr. Zupanic?
What happened?
Uh, there was an incident.
You were struck by flying glass.
Did you lose something?
Yeah. My good luck.
Would that be Betty or Lulu, Mr. Zupanic?
Where are they, Mr. Zupanic?
Excuse me.
- F.B.I. - Can I help you?
Yes, I'm looking for... that girl.
Betty. This man's from the F.B.I.
I think we both know why I'm here.
- It's her fault! - Lulu Pfeiffer.
She follows me around trying to ruin my life.
I'm not gonna let her ruin it this time. It's either me or her.
I don't want to leave Kansas.
- Scully. - Hey, Scully.
I found her at Koko's Copy Center.
- Betty Templeton? - Yeah.
She says that Lulu Pfeiffer's trying to ruin her life.
- Follows her wherever she goes. - Lulu Pfeiffer works at Koko's too.
That's exactly what Lulu says about Betty,
except she says this is the end of the line, that she's not leaving Kansas.
- That's exactly what Betty said. - What's going on here?
I don't know, Scully. You're running this show. Why don't you tell me?
I think that this is more than just physical proximity, Mulder.
I think that these women have some kind of a psychic connection.
- No...  Sherlock.
Hey, Scully, uh, where's Lulu?
She just took off, Mulder. She left work, and she drove away.
She wouldn't be driving a little blue convertible, would she?
That's exactly what she's driving.
Oh, crap.
- Can I help you? - Uh, yes.
I'm looking for someone. He was here speaking to an employee,
and I can't seem to reach him.
- Tall guy, dark hair? He left. - Yeah.
- And you don't know where he went? - Couldn't say.
- Okay. - However, I can tell you...
we have a two-for-one copy discount in effect.
- How about Internet access? - Right this way.
- Is he in there? - Yeah. Sleeping.
- Can you wake him up for me? - You sure you wanna do that?
- It's important. - Will you two shut up or go away?
Mr. Damfuse?
The sound of your voice is like a jackhammer on my eardrums!
Mr. Damfuse, I'm Special Agent Dana Scully with the F.B.I.
What's so special about you?
It's an F.B. I title, sir.
I know it is. I'm not stupid!
Mr. Damfuse, if you'll let me explain why I'm here,
we might be able to get you to bed a little bit sooner.
Ah! What a relief!
Mr. Damfuse, through a lot of matching up of documents...
that I have been able to compile on the Internet...
and by comparing time and space and circumstance...
and by liberally applying the law of averages...
They could electrocute me quicker!
I believe that you may be the father of two daughters.
I'm no father!
Using documents filed by a sperm bank in Sparta, Illinois...
and by the mothers who may have been impregnated by your donation...
I Yankee Doodled into a plastic cup!
And it is very important for their safety and for the safety of others...
and anything about your family tree that may be able to explain...
the reactions that are being caused by these two girls.
A big ugly dog lifted its leg on my family tree!
Make room for Daddy.
Shut up, you fat ox!
- Oh. - You aren't answering your phone?
I'm just screening my calls.
You sleep with me once and now you're avoiding me?
I got... big trouble, baby.
I got just one shot left for the big time. Just one.
But you got your match tonight. Your name's up on the marquee.
I've lost my financing.
- You're my good luck, baby. - I am?
It was my good luck to meet you.
And if you could just...
They say I'm old, I'm washed up.
All I want's a shot.
If I don't get the money, I'm gonna lose my chance.
Maybe I can.
You're not answering your phone?
Lulu?
Someone else you were expecting? Well?
Baby, I got trouble. I got big trouble.
- Mulder?
- Yeah. - Where have you been?
Seeing a side of Kansas City few men have the privilege to see.
- What happened to you? - I got sucked into a storm drain.
I don't know, but I have been able to locate the nature of their connection.
Both women are nonfraternal siblings from the same father.
- You've located him? - Yeah. He's here in the state pen.
When is all this yammering gonna stop?
And he's given you insight?
Well, the biggest thing that I can figure out right now...
is he's probably the angriest man in the world, Mulder.
Not as angry as those two women are gonna be...
when they both realize they're in love with the one and only Bert Zupanic.
- They're both after him? - They're both in love with him.
That's why they're both staying in Kansas City and they won't leave.
Well, if they're the reason, it doesn't explain what's happening,
what's causing this phenomenon or how we're gonna make it stop.
I don't know. You're the one who's supposed to have all the answers.
Somebody's got to get to that fight and keep those two women apart,
or else this time the... is going to hit the fans.
Well, hi.
Mr. Zupanic?
- Goin'to Kansas City
Kansas City, here I come
Goin'to Kansas City
Kansas City, here I come
- You said you'd have my money.
I'll have it. I swear I will.
I'll call off the damn fight, Titanic.
I'll have these people cursing your very name!
I'm telling you it'll be here.
Don't worry. I promise.
Bert!
Bert, I got it.
How about ya, buddy?
Let's get ready to rumble.
Oh, baby, I knew you wouldn't let me down.
It's you and me... all the way.
- Yeah!
Ladies and gentlemen,
get out your seats and on your feets...
for our own hometown boy,
Whoo!
Bert "the Titanic"...
Zupanic!
- Go, Titanic! - Oh! Oh, yeah!
Let's take him, baby! Let's take him, baby!
Whoo!
- Whoo!
Come on!
-  Titanic!
Oh, yeah! Come on!
Whoo-hoo! Go, Titanic!
You can do it, Titanic!
Betty Templeton.
My name is Fox Mulder. I'm with the F.B.I. Can you come with me?
I'm watching the fight!
Don't make me have to remove you, ma'am.
I can't believe this.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here? I'm Bert's good luck.
- He's mine! - Over my dead body!
Stop it! Stop it! You're going down, lady!
I'm gonna kick your butt from here till Tuesday!
Stick a fork in you! You're done! Hi, baby.
- Betty? - Bert, keep it up. I love you, baby!
- Bert, I got the money. - Lulu?
Kick his butt, Bert.
-  Lulu!
No! Bert!
Oh, my.
Oh, my God!
What?
Why...
Fifty million anonymous donations...
have been made to sperm banks across the U.S.
Most have produced healthy offspring for single mothers...
or fertility-challenged couples while some of them have not.
Bert Zupanic and his nonfraternal biological sibling...
both small-time bank robbers, part-time pro wrestlers,
both with too many idiosyncratic behaviorisms to list...
stood a 27-million-to-one chance of ever meeting,
but they did.
Damn, those are some odds.
Betty Templeton and Lulu Pfeiffer...
products of different mothers but the same father,
an angry drifter now doing time for counterfeiting...
chanced to meet 12 years ago,
but couldn't seem to avoid each other's compulsively identical mannerisms...
mannerisms attributable to their perpetually angry father.
Hmm. What does it all mean?
I've been thinking hard about that, Mr. Saperstein.
I would like to say it has something to do with balance in the universe...
the attraction of opposites and the repulsion of equivalents.
Or, that over time, nature produces only so many originals...
that when two original copies meet, that the result is often unpredictable.
If four should meet, the result is...
Well, suffice to say,
it's betterjust to avoid these encounters altogether...
and at all costs.
I think Agent Mulder would agree with me.
Uh-huh.

Radio check. Perimeter is clear.
Copy that. Give me a check every ten.
Why don't you folks make yourselves comfortable?
Watch some television. Get some rest.
Try to put your minds at ease.
Just try to stay away from the windows and the doors, if you would.
Do we have to ask you if we can use the bathroom?
I feel like I'm a prisoner in my own home.
Ma'am, I apologize for the imposition, but my job is to protect you.
As of this evening, the FBI's top priority is keeping you safe.
For how long? A week, a month? Then what?
Jim, don't do this, please.
You don't have to testify.
It's not worth it. These people have a long reach. They're powerful.
I have to do this.
I'm going to bed.
Thank you.
The grand jury convenes at 9:00. We'll leave here at 7:30.
I'll be right outside the door if you need me.
Jim?
Jim?
Are you feeling all right?
Jim?
Mr. Skinner! Mr. Skinner!
- Jim! - Dr. Scobie?
- Jim! - Ma'am.
Yes, at the time I was in another part of the house.
Yes. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, I will have answers for you. I...
I...
Follow me.
There's fingerprints everywhere, but as they all belong to the deceased...
and his wife, they don't help us.
- This is where the body was found? - Yeah.
What can you tell us about him?
Dr. James Scobie, age 44, R&D biochemist with Morley Tobacco.
If he were alive as of 26 minutes ago,
Testimony concerning what?
Not even his wife or his lawyer know the specifics.
Only that it concerns research that he was involved in.
Potentially extremely damaging to Morley.
Enough so that Scobie received death threats.
Given the high profile nature of the case,
the director charged me with insuring Dr. Scobie's protection.
Though we've yet to determine how someone got in here or...
what killed him.
You can't blow a whistle with a mouth like that.
It's almost as if his flesh has been stripped or eaten away.
I mean, an assailant could have thrown acid on him.
Well, if it was acid in the face, he would have screamed bloody murder.
Well, we're looking at all possibilities, Agent.
We need answers. We don't have a lot of time.
And we're going up against one of the biggest corporations in America.
The director instructed me that he wants this case closed as swiftly as possible.
I trust I can count on your help.
- I'll get right on it. - Thank you.
- Huh. - What?
There's no ashtrays. Dr. Scobie and his wife don't smoke?
Not that I witnessed.
Tobacco employee that doesn't smoke.
Isn't that kind of like a GM executive who drives a Ford?
If this was a hit, it seems unnecessarily high profile.
It kind of draws attention to itself, don't you think?
That could be the point... to intimidate potential witnesses.
Scobie had a supervisor at Morley... a Dr. Peter Voss.
- I wanna talk to him. - You mind if I tag along?
- No. -  Sir?
We're here to see Dr. Voss.
Do you have an appointment?
Do you have an appointment?
Maybe you missed this the first time around.
Gentlemen, I can help you.
Daniel Brimley, head of corporate security. A pleasure.
Nice to meet you.
Nobody was happy about Jim's decision,
but the timing of his death couldn't have been worse.
So you have no problem with us speaking to Dr. Voss?
Absolutely not. Whatever we can do to help. Please.
Could you, um...
Could you give my sincerest condolences toJim's wifeJoan?
How is she?
I'm sure she'll take comfort in finding out why her husband died.
We know it had to do with company research.
I'm sorry. Dr. Voss would be in violation...
of his employment confidentiality clause in answering that question.
- Dr. Scobie was your friend? - Yeah, for 14 years.
And yet you demoted him five weeks ago.
You took him off a particular project. Can you tell us why that happened?
As before, Dr. Voss would be in violation...
here at Morley.
I'm not sensing any cooperation whatsoever.
In fact, I'm one more nonanswer away from getting...
a federal warrant and searching this entire building.
- Then this meeting is over. Dr. Voss. - Dr. Voss.
Can you tell me what that is?
- It's a tobacco beetle. Why? - I found it atJim Scobie's house.
Well, you'll find a lot of these around here. They're everywhere.
There's probably a dozen in the grill of your car right now.
May I ask where you're going with this, Agent?
I'm sorry. I can't.
Answering that question would violate FBI confidentiality...
due to the sensitive nature of our investigation.
Evenin'.
- What are you doing here? - I run out of smokes.
Me and Dr. Scobie had an arrangement, as you know.
So I figured, uh, Dr. Scobie not bein' around,
that my arrangement with him... slides on over to you.
Here ya go.
That won't hold me.
I'll bring you more. Just don't come here anymore.
All right?
It seems everybody's actin' funny around me all of a sudden, you know.
Tellin' me not to talk, to stay away from their houses.
- Huh. - Too bad about Dr. Scobie.
- Yeah. - I bet people are wondering how he died.
I've been working my own theory up in the old noggin.
I'd be happy to share it with you someday.
I think that you should leave now.
Yeah.
I don't wanna wear out my welcome.
We'll be seein' a lot of each other, I expect.
- Smoke 'em if you got 'em. - What have you found?
Well, the tissue damage on Dr. Scobie's mouth extends...
all the way down his trachea into his lungs.
His alveoli looked like corned beef.
What about this being the result of some sort of corrosive agent?
No, that's not the case. There's no acids present, no caustics.
This damage isn't the result of any kind of chemical reaction.
His airways have more or less just been reamed out.
Hypoxemia: The inability to transfer oxygen...
from the lungs to the bloodstream.
He choked to death?
All right. I mean, this damage,
however it was accomplished, someone did do this to him.
Well, not necessarily. There weren't any signs of struggle in the room.
- Maybe no one was ever there. - Where are you going with this?
Well, that this isn't a homicide. You examined the body, Scully.
Did you find any of these?
- A bug? - It's a tobacco beetle.
I didn't find anything like that, Mulder.
Were you expecting me to?
Killer bugs? This is what I'm supposed to tell the director?
I don't know, but judging from Dr. Voss's reaction to this,
I think it's the thing we should investigate.
I've been tellin' you all week. How many times I gotta say it?
No smoking! You hear me?
America, man!
E Pluribus, uh...
I'll get you kicked out, you son of a bitch! You think I'm kiddin'?
I'll do it!
The law's on my side!
Guests check in, but they don't check out.
Well, judging from the condition of the body,
I'd say that he died in the same manner as Dr. Scobie.
Except this man's no corporate whistle blower.
Thomas Gastall. Out-of-date Massachusetts license,
food coupons...
and a certificate of completion for a court-ordered anger management class.
What could Morley Tobacco have against a transient from Massachusetts?
- Probably nothing. - What are you suggesting, Mulder?
ThatJim Scobie wasn't murdered. Neither was this man.
Well, then what killed them?
These.
We didn't find any insects in Dr. Scobie's bathroom.
But there was an open window through which they could have escaped.
It's a long shot, Mulder, but it could be some form of contagious agent,
like an insect-borne bacterium,
which would mean there might be other victims in this building.
FBI.
Sorry to wake you.
No, you didn't wake me.
Come on in.
Thank you.
Do you know him?
I knew his voice.
He yelled a lot.
He yelled?
Yeah, he said I smoked too much.
What are you gonna do, man? It's a free country.
E Pluribus, uh...
- Do you mind? - No.
You don't seem surprised that he's dead.
I guess his number come up.
I'm just glad it wasn't me.
- Well, what is your name, sir? - Darryl Weaver.
Mr. Weaver, did you see or hear anything unusual last night?
Little Korean fella down the hall dresses like Wonder Woman.
- But that's every night. - Other than that?
There wouldn't happen to be, uh, any reward money involved,
would there?
I mean, I could use an extra buck or two.
Ain't that always the way.
No, my mind is, uh, just drawin' a complete blank.
That's my card.
Thank you, Mr. Weaver.
Anything?
Two deaths in less than 24 hours and we've yet to come up with an answer.
And the only thing I have to go on medically at this point is Mulder's bug.
You know, I know an entomologist at UNC Willmington... Dr. Libby Nance.
Good. Talk to her.
Where you going?
To see about something else that's been bugging me.
- Mrs. Voss? - Yes?
Fox Mulder. Is your husband home?
I really shouldn't be talking to you without our lawyers.
I understand your reluctance to talk, sir.
You have a nice family, a lot to lose.
What do you want, Agent Mulder?
There's been another victim... Thomas Gastall.
Died exactly the same way Scobie did.
I'm sorry to hear that.
But what's that got to do with me?
Well, we found these all over him.
I believe that that's what killed both men.
Tobacco beetle. It's an herbivore. It eats tobacco.
- Hence its name. - I understand that,
but... maybe these don't.
But why are you hiding behind your lawyers, Doctor?
How many people have to die before you do the right thing?
- I'll get it!
- Hello? -  What did he want?
- Are you spying on me? - I'm not spying on you, Peter.
I'm looking out for you. What did he want?
There's been another death... downtown.
- How did it happen? - I don't know. I don't know.
This has gone on long enough. We should come forward. I should.
Do you hear what you're saying, Peter?
Now, I want you to just take a moment.
I want you to think about what really matters to you.
Now tell me where I can find Darryl Weaver.
- Why? - This was my mistake. I'll clean it up.
- I don't know where he is.
This doesn't make sense.
What doesn't make sense?
Well, it's a Lasioderma serricorne... a tobacco beetle.
Only I've never seen one exactly like this.
Hmm. What are the differences?
Physical differences.
Minor, but definitely notable.
Deviations in the mandibles, the antennae,
the body segmentation.
What if such deviations arose from genetic engineering?
- Engineering the bugs themselves? - No.
I was actually thinking about another possibility... transgenomics.
- Which is? - It's a form of DNA manipulation...
alterations made on the genetic level.
It is pretty widely known that tobacco companies have been pouring money...
into that kind of research.
Changing the tobacco plant itself in order to make it heartier,
give it less nicotine, more nicotine,
make it naturally menthol flavored.
- You name it. - A form of what... super tobacco?
Which possibly could have created super bugs.
I guess the real question is,
could they have become dangerous to humans?
Mr. Weaver!
Mr. Weaver!
Sorry, Doc. No vacancy.
- What happened there?
Well, you tell me.
You're the one with the PhD.
I'm just a big old guinea pig.
Uh, listen.
Um, you have to leave town.
And give up all this?
Me not doin' my part for science?
Here.
Take it. It's everything I have in the bank.
Four thousand.
It's not much, but, uh, it's a start.
W-W-Wait a minute. I'm not kidding. You gotta get out of here.
Why?
I got a good thing goin' here.
I got cash money.
I got all the coffin nails I can suck down.
Although, lately,
I've been thinkin' this particular brand,
it doesn't, uh, do anyone else any favors,
health-wise.
You thinkin' that too, huh?
Would it bother you if I lit one up?
Toodles.
No, you... you don't understand.
Morley is a multibillion dollar global corporation.
You think they're gonna let you endanger that, huh? They'll kill you first.
Well, it sounds like a Darryl Weaver problem to me.
Yeah, uh...
What am I looking at?
Thomas Gastall's left lung and bronchus.
Well, I guess that explains where the beetles came from.
Hey, Mulder. Where have you been?
Talking to lawyers over atJustice tryin' to get a look at Morley's files.
Well, take a look at this.
They're the larval stage of the tobacco beetle, Mulder.
And somehow they have ended up nesting in Thomas Gastall's lungs.
The larvae must pupate inside the lungs,
and then once they mature into beetles, exit the body en masse.
- That explains the condition of the face and throat.
Only how did they get into the lungs to begin with?
Mulder?
How is he?
And so far, we're having some luck at clearing his lungs.
there may be a dozen eggs that have yet to be hatched.
And they're going to hatch. It's just, uh,
we're buying time.
How did this happen? These eggs, how'd they get into his lungs?
I'm thinking he inhaled them.
That's where it lays its eggs.
If those genetically-altered beetles that we found did that,
then maybe the eggs survived the processing into cigarettes.
Like spores or pollen. Somehow small enough to be airborne.
But Mulder isn't a smoker. And neither was Scobie.
Maybe they were around someone who was.
Don't bother calling security.
Federal search warrant as promised.
Do it.
You're gonna talk to me, Doctor.
One of my agents is dying of the same thing that killed Dr. Scobie.
I believe you have information that can save him.
We stand by our contention that any information is proprietary...
and is therefore the sole property of Morley Tobacco.
Listen to me, you son of a bitch.
This isn't about Morley or your precious research.
This is about saving lives.
I'm advising you not to speak.
This has gone on long enough.
We thought we were doing a good thing.
We knew people were never gonna stop smoking, no matter how unhealthy it was.
So why not genetically engineer a safer cigarette?
Except you engineered the bugs as well.
We recruited test smokers.
We conducted focus groups. There were no problems.
And, uh, after a few months in,
things... things got bad.
We had four test subjects and, uh,
three of them died.
Is that what Dr. Scobie was gonna testify about?
Yeah.
And the company wanted us to keep it quiet.
I thought let's correct the mistakes and face the consequences.
Jim didn't.
He was monitoring the focus group, and that's...
that's how he got infected.
You said only three died.
Who was the fourth?
- Clear! - Okay, go ahead.
- Told me he meant to get Weaver. - Looks like Weaver got to him first.
Mr. Brimley, can you hear me?
You got Mickey's Big Mouth?
There's no smoking in here.
Mickey's Big Mouth?
Anything else? A carton of cigarettes?
You don't have my brand.
Must be bad.
How do you feel?
Like a Dustbuster attacked me.
We're looking for someone who may be able to help you.
A Morley test subject by the name of Darryl Weaver.
Mr. E Pluribus. Yeah.
Well, Mr. Weaver seems to have some kind of tolerance or immunity,
Mulder?
Doctor!
His sat's down to 72.
Get some O2 on him and call the code.
- Susan, code blue! -  Right, Doctor.
Over to my side!
Dr. Scully?
We've got him stabilized on ECMO for the moment,
but we're not gonna be able to maintain him on it for long.
Of course you see why.
There's more than there were six hours ago.
I think this time we have to crack the chest.
No.
No, uh, he's too weak for thoracic surgery. He'd die on the table.
I don't know what our other options are.
I'd say for the time being, we just wait.
That'll definitely kill him...
sooner or later.
Mrs. Voss, I'm Assistant Director Walter Skinner with the FBI.
- May we come in? - What is this? What's going on?
- He's not here. - He told me he was headed home.
Behind you.
I was just leavin'. I got what I came for.
He took the test cigarettes. I couldn't stop him.
Stop right there!
Why?
You gonna shoot me?
I'm not gonna let you go and infect more people.
You're gonna let me do whatever I wanna do.
Dr. Voss here tells me you need me.
You need me to save your boy.
Don't do it.
They say these things kill people, you know.
Any brand, sooner or later.
But you know, it doesn't have to be that way.
I think Dr. Voss is really...
on to something with his research, I do.
It's over, Weaver. I'm through.
Oh.
Come on, now. I mean, you gotta figure...
the first, uh, car...
killed a bunch of people...
before they perfected it,
'cause it's all just part of the scientific process, you know.
Mr. Weaver, I will shoot you.
No, you won't.
I'm a regular damn scientific marvel.
They're gonna study me.
They're gonna write scientific papers about me.
I could be the cure for cancer.
Me, Darryl Weaver.
You ain't gonna shoot me.
Toodles.
-  How's Mulder? - Not good.
Let's get the blood work on this man.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Give me 30 milligrams of methyl-pyrrolidinyl-pyridine.
- Nicotine? - Yeah.
I think this could save Mulder's life.
Hey. Good to be back?
-  Beats the alternative. - Yeah.
Well, you'll be interested to know that Morley Tobacco has subpoenaed...
all of our files on the case.
It was the nicotine itself that was keeping him alive?
His fingertips were stained yellow with it. He was a four-pack a day smoker,
far heavier than any of the focus group members who died.
You know, nicotine is extremely poisonous.
It's actually one of the oldest known insecticides.
It's good for killing tobacco beetles.
Well, once we loaded your system up with enough of it,
it acted as a sort of chemotherapy.
Except it almost stopped your breathing at the same time.
That's not all it did.
I bought these on the way to work.
You're not gonna start smoking.
Why not? They say the addiction is stronger than heroin.
Mulder.
Good. Skinner's waiting for us in his office.
I'll be right up.

God's love will set us free.
And I believe...
if I pray for that love,
if I get down on my knees...
and allow God to enter my hardened, lonely, miserable heart...
and change me through and through,
that miracle... will come.
Now, who here believes that with me?
Do you?
- Do you? - Yes, sir, I believe it.
Do you?
Well, believe, because God's love is not just some slogan.
It's a promise...
straight to you from the Lord Almighty himself.
A promise paid for with the blood of His only begotten Son,
Jesus Christ of Nazareth.
All you have to do is believe.
-  Amen! - God's love will set you free.
Now doesn't that just lift up your heart...
and make you want to say, "Glory! Amen!"
Glory! Amen!
Join with me. Allow the spirit ofJesus Christ...
to show you the way up to our Heavenly Father.
- Glory! Amen! - Glory! Amen!
Let God's love free you from your prison...
and deliver you to His side in heaven.
- Glory! Amen! - Glory! Amen!
Praise His name. Praise His holy love.
- Glory! Amen! - Glory! Amen!
- Glory! Amen! - Glory! Amen!
- Glory! Amen! - Glory! Amen!
Glory! Amen!
Glory! Amen!
Glory! Amen!
Glory! Amen!
Glory! Amen!
Glory! Amen!
Do you believe that, Donny? That God loves a sack of crap like you?
you get to burn in hell.
- Glory. Amen. Glory. Amen. - You listening to me?
God's got a place for you, all right, you sick puke.
Then where's that leave you?
Sorry. It's not good enough for the Illinois penal system.
My hands! My hands!
Life without chance of parole...
for the premeditated and sadistic sexual murders...
of five Twin Cities women in 1994.
Donald Addy Faster.
You two put this man away.
Yeah. Someone forgot to throw away the key.
That's another story.
Right now we have to apprehend this man.
Donny Faster is a death fetishist...
a collector of bone and dead flesh, of toenails and hair.
It's what floats his boat, gets him off.
- He's a sick man. - Sick would describe him.
- So it's just women he's after. - Just women.
I happen to know you two agents have a particular forte,
a thing for... what is it called... the supernatural?
Now, the circumstances of the escape...
I promise you there is nothing supernatural about this man.
Donny Faster is just plain evil.
Case closed.
You didn't look at the file, did you?
A man escaped from prison.
Not a man. Donny Faster.
He didn't just escape. He walked out.
- Isn't that why we're here? - That's why I'm here.
I don't know about you. Why are you here?
- Go home, Scully. - Mulder, this case doesn't bother me.
The man abducted you.
Donny Faster did a number on your head like I've never seen.
And it's okay to... walk away.
It's not a question of if I should stay. I don't have a choice.
So let's get to work.
Well, this isn't the first incident.
Two prisoners have escaped from maximum security facilities...
in neighboring states over the past year.
At 6:06 this morning, Donny Faster made it three.
6:06?
And what's so supernatural about that?
Dozens of witnesses, guards and staff and no one seems to remember anything.
For a while they didn't even know these guys were missing.
I'm a Christian, man.
Then I know you'll tell me the truth.
Yeah. But I got no idea about Donny Faster...
or how he broke out.
Well, it wasn't just me. There was a lot of us in the shop.
Yeah, but you had something happen. You had an incident.
Yeah, something like that.
You cried out to the guards that you'd cut your hands.
My fingers, man. I saw them all cut off.
- Others saw them too. - No, but I felt them cut off.
How do you explain that?
God works in mysterious ways, brother.
- Glory. Amen.
Glory. Amen.
Glory.
Amen.
Posthypnotic suggestion. Did you see him?
You mean did I see him raise his foot? Yes, I saw that.
Programmed behavior prompted and manifested by suggestion.
In this case, a rhythmic motion of the hands...
producing an unconscious act in a conscious state.
It doesn't work on you.
- I know what hypnosis is, Mulder. - Group hypnosis.
If you're suggesting that Donny Faster escaped from prison...
using a technique from a Vegas lounge act, I'd think again.
Messmer was able to hypnotize and command entire audiences.
So, how would Donny have acquired this amazing ability?
- I'm not saying that it was Donny. - Well, then who?
Three inmates are missing from three separate prisons.
One man has had possible contact with each of those cons.
The prison chaplain. Glory. Amen.
- Not God. The chaplain.
Scully, what?
That song, can you hear that?
Barely.
Well, I think if it was a make-out song, I think it'd be ruined forever now, huh?
Oh, girl, don't look any further
Looking for something to eat?
Me?
How 'bout... today's special?
- You aren't a narc, are you? - No.
- You're looking at my hands. - You need a buff and polish.
What are you, a freak?
I-I just got out of prison.
Hey, missy, leave the customers alone!
Hey, missy, leave the customers alone!
I'll do it for free.
You just got out of prison and you wanna give me a manicure?
I'll even do your cuticles.
You receive the Lord's grace, and this is your thanks.
- What? - Who do you think got you out of prison?
I don't care. I'm busy right now.
The grace of God got you out.
And it's the only thing that will keep you out.
- I thought you were kidding. - He's chosen you, Donny.
Later.
- You called them on me. - No.
Then do something.
I have a car.
- We aren't going to make it to the car. - It's within his power.
Glory. Amen.
- Glory. Amen.
- Is he here? - Well, uh...
We're trying to determine that.
Did you see him?
We got a call about a possible sighting of the suspect.
- Something happened here, huh? -  Guy got hit by a car.
Prison chaplain, it turns out.
- A Reverend Orison.
Paramedics took him to the hospital. He's in pretty bad shape.
Excuse me. Could you turn that up, please?
- Yeah. - What you need is a lover
Someone to take over
Oh, girl Don't look any further
And it's strange
When you think of the chances
You're lucky to be alive, Rev. Orison.
- Who are you? - Special Agent Dana Scully.
Believe in the Lord, Agent Scully. He believes in you.
That's nice. But my partner and I are more concerned...
Don't be concerned. God has them.
What do you mean?
- Reverend? - You're a believer, aren't you?
- This has nothing to do with me, sir. - Has everything to do with you.
You have faith. Have had faith.
You hear Him calling you,
but you're unsure of what to do.
It's not exactly a long shot, sir.
You stand as you do now,
neither here nor there, longing,
but afraid, waiting for a sign.
Well, the signs are everywhere.
What happened to the inmates, sir?
Everything has a reason, Scout...
everything on God's earth.
Every moment of every day...
the devil waits for but an instant.
As it is, it has always been,
the devil's instant is our eternity.
The good reverend. How do you do?
Or maybe I should say, how do you do it?
His is the word.
I am but the messenger who delivers it.
- Well, this delivery arrived a little late.
A little late and a little cold,
as a matter of fact.
I thought you'd want to see it.
What is this?
Blood of the lamb, Reverend.
The handiwork of Mr. Donny Faster.
Where is he, Reverend?
He took my car.
She wasn't supposed to die.
No, Donny was supposed to die.
You were supposed to kill him.
That's why you freed him.
God knows you're capable of it.
Rev. Orison is really Robert Gailen Orison,
convicted in 1959 of first degree murder.
Served 22 years in Solidad.
God spoke to me.
He told me to look after Donny.
When God spoke to you, Reverend,
did He happen to mention where Donny was headed?
- Where are you going, Mulder? - To prove that man's a liar.
How do you prove that somebody isn't being directed by God?
You don't believe that it happened?
God is a spectator, Scully. He just reads the box scores.
So, what? You think God directs him to...
let the prisoners out to kill?
No, but I believe that the reverend believes what's he's saying...
that it's God working through him.
Well, plenty of nut bags do.
Has He ever spoken to you?
I'm trying not to take offense.
What did He say?
Mulder, I have heard that song three times now.
That may not mean anything to you, but it means something to me.
- What does it mean? - I never thought about it before.
What?
When I was 13, my father was stationed in San Diego.
I was listening to the radio to that song...
when my mother came in and told me that my Sunday schoolteacher had been killed.
- Mmm. - He'd been murdered in his front yard.
And that's the first time I ever felt there was real evil in the world.
Mulder, Rev. Orison called me "Scout."
That's the same name my Sunday schoolteacher called me.
Donny Faster escaped from prison at 6:06 a.m.
So, what do you think that God is telling you?
Police are involved in a four-state manhunt...
for a prisoner who escaped maximum security in Marion, Illinois.
He was last seen driving a green 1970...
Chevrolet Impala with a black landau top.
He is described as six feet tall, medium build...
It's a cerebral edema.
A swelling of the brain.
A trauma not uncommon with this kind of head injury or accident.
Except this isn't accidental.
The cause, in fact, as it was stated to me, is self-inflicted.
There's a small hole here in the skull...
which allows oxygen into the brain cavity.
pumping through his brain.
- And he did this himself? - Yeah.
My guess is he probably did it when he first got into prison...
when he first learned how to use its powers.
- "Its powers"? - There's a theory...
that at this point in human evolution our mental capabilities...
are limited only by inadequate blood supply.
In fact, centuries ago in the Peruvian Andes,
or drill small holes.
So this hole in his head enables Rev. Orison to help these prisoners escape?
Yeah. The practitioners of this...
found that they could perform certain mental tricks.
One of which they called "stopping the world."
Nobody can stop the world. I don't care how many holes they have in their head.
But maybe they can alter perception of it,
But why? I mean, even if you could, why?
Donny Faster is serving a life sentence without possibility of parole.
or in the eyes of a man who thinks he's God's tool.
Well, then if Rev. Orison meant to kill Donny Faster,
then why is he still alive?
I don't know. Maybe he unleashed something that he couldn't control.
Maybe he thought he was opening the door of perception,
but then unwittingly he... opened the gates of hell.
What?
Glory. Amen. Glory. Amen.
- Glory. Amen.
Are you Donald?
Yes.
I'm from Tip Top Gentlemen Service.
This isn't your place, is it?
- No. Why? - 'Cause I was coming up the stairs...
and got stopped by the landlord, like it's any of his business.
He told me some Rev. Orison lives here.
- Now, you ain't no preacher, are you? - No.
Good. They always like the weirdest things.
You know what I mean?
- You okay? - Yes.
Something you wanna say?
Love your hair.
What are you doin'?
Is your hair chemically treated?
My hair?
I don't know which product to use.
Look, you're not usin' no product. I'm clean, my hair's clean.
Well, be a gentleman and get me a towel. I'm gonna get out of here.
It's a wig.
They lied to me.
You lied to me!
- Where'd he go? - Marshal?
- Marshal? - What?
The prisoner, the man you were guarding in this room, what happened to him?
He's gone, Scully. So is the marshal's gun.
You didn't see him?
Let's go, Scully.
-  What is it? - What does this mean?
- Did you tell him? - No, I only told you.
He must have, uh, overheard us when we were talking in the hallway.
I didn't mention the name of the song.
- I'm sure you did. - No, I'm sure I didn't, Mulder.
Well, maybe this was meant for you.
"Don't look any further."
"Whosoever sheddeth man's blood,
by man shall his blood be shed."
What are you doing?
Taking you home.
"The wicked will be punished."
Pray for God's love, Donny.
Find the humility in yourself to allow God into your heart.
All you have to do is believe.
Repent.
You'll feel God's love come to show you the way to His heavenly kingdom.
Are you sorry for what you've done?
You...
What did you say?
Never... No...
No...
- Why are you crying? - I can't...
Beg His forgiveness for what you did to those girls,
for what you did to all those poor helpless girls.
My violence is always waiting for an instant...
for when His back is turned.
You can see it now.
Are you crying for your sins... or for yourself?
No, Reverend.
I cry for you.
Because you cannot kill me.
You know, it's funny. When all is said and done, there's...
not much mystery in murder.
And for that, I owe you an apology, Mulder.
- What do you mean? - Well, you were right.
I was looking too hard for connections that weren't there.
Orison was a murderer, plain and simple.
I guess in his own twisted way he was making good with his God.
Glory. Amen. Let's go home, Scully.
Donny Faster placed the call to the police that led us out here.
It's almost like he's begging us to hunt him down.
This X-File is over. Lying dead there in a grave he dug himself.
Let's let the U.S. Marshals take over from here.
Don't look any further, Scully.
- This is Fox Mulder. Leave a message after the...
- Agent Mulder, MarshalJoe Danno in Marion.
I just talked to a call girl who I.D. 'd Donny Faster as an attacker.
Claims Faster got real upset when she was wearing a red wig...
upset she wasn't a redhead.
This mean anything to you? I'd appreciate a call back.
Go back to hell!
- Who does your nails, girly girl? - Let me go!
The only reason why you're alive is because I asked the judge for life!
You're the one that got away.
- You're all I think about. - I'm a federal agent.
You do anything to me and they will not give you a break this time.
I'm going to run you a bath.
Don't look any further
Now, be good and don't cause me any problems.
Someone to count on
In a world ever changing
Here I am Stop where you're standing
What you need is a lover
Someone to take over
- Oh, girl, don't look any further
And it's strange
Oh, baby
Don't look any further
Tonight
We're gonna take it
All night long, baby, daylight
Daylight
I'll still be lookin' in your heavenly eyes
And we'll go on and on
Don't look any further
Don't look any further
Someone to count on
In a world ever changing
Here I am, baby
Stop right where you're standing
What you need is a lover
Someone to take over
Here I am, baby Don't look any further
Further
- Excuse me. -  Yeah, sure.
If you want to pack some things, we can get out of here.
- You can't judge yourself.
Maybe I don't have to.
The Bible allows for vengeance.
But the law doesn't.
The way I see it, he didn't give you a choice.
And my report will reflect that,
in case you're worried.
Donny Faster would have surely killed again if given the chance.
He was evil, Mulder.
I'm sure about that without a doubt.
But there's one thing that I'm not sure of.
What's that?
Who was at work in me?
Or what?
What made me...
What made me pull the trigger?
You mean if it was God?
I mean, what if it wasn't?

Anson? Anson? Where are you, Anson?
Anson. Come back, Anson.
Anson. Calling Anson.
Where are you, Anson?
Anson.!
Anson. Calling Anson.
Where are you, Anson?
Anson.!
Where are you, Anson?
Anson, get out here!
I've warned you about your attitude.
You clean out 407?
No, of course you haven't cleaned out 407.
You've only had all damn morning.
You think you're ever going to own any of those boats the way you're going?
You think you're ever going to amount to anything?
You can't even finish a simple job.
A monkey could do this job, all right, Jay?
Well, you can't. So what's that say about you?
- Shut up. - Excuse me?
I didn't catch that.
You clean out 407, you move out that deadbeat's stuff, and you do it now.
And when I come back in an hour, it better be done.
Anson!
Anson?
- Son of a...
Anson.
Anson!
Oh, that's it, Anson.
You hear me, Ans...
Can I get you some coffee?
Water? Anything?
Good morning.
- Good morning.
Special Agent Dana Scully, this is, uh, Jay Gilmore.
How... Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet... Likewise.
Mr. Gilmore came all the way to see us from Missouri, the "Show Me" State.
They told me you were the people to best understand my sit... my sit...
It's okay. Uh, this is Mr. Gilmore's situation.
This condition came on very suddenly about a month ago.
Anson Stokes, he did this to me.
I don't know how. I just... I know it was him.
Anson Stokes is a former employee...
at the self-storage yard that Mr. Gilmore owns.
Apparently there was some bad blood between you two.
He told me to shut up! Huh?
Yeah. And then Mr. Gilmore was, uh, stricken...
- Stricken... stricken. - Uh-huh.
And Anson Stokes was nowhere to be found.
Do you know what he said? He said they had nothing on him.
Well, and to be fair, sir, they didn't. They don't.
They had to make me a whole new mouth.
Do you think Blue Cross is going to pay for this? Uh-uh.
I demand justice!
Ow.
- Mulder, all I'm saying is that... - I know.
This may not be a crime, and this guy Stokes may not know anything about it.
Look, there is a condition called microstomia... small mouth...
which is brought on by the disease scleroderma.
It's the overproduction of collagen.
It can actually reduce a person's mouth to a tiny little opening.
But that takes months to develop, right?
It doesn't just happen in the blink of an eye. Gilmore's surgeons are stumped.
They're writing it up in the New England Journal of Medicine.
There's always nasal aplasia, the complete absence of the nose.
That's a nose, Scully. We're talking mouth here.
But what we're talking is medical, physiological, not criminal.
- Not as far as I can see. - Maybe, but I still want to know...
That's a little... out of place, wouldn't you say?
A little bit.
Ah, damn it.
- Leslie! - What? What is it?
I.R.S. agents. Gotta be. Get rid of them, all right?
Hi. We're looking for a Mr. Anson Stokes.
He's not here.
Would you happen to know when he's coming back?
Well, we are Agents Mulder and Scully from the F.B.I.
The boat's... The boat's not ours.
We're holding it for someone, and, you know, th-they pay the taxes on it.
Okay.
Anson's not here.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What's your name?
- Leslie Stokes. - Oh, you're Anson's brother?
Hi there.
We're not here to talk about the boat, Leslie.
We want to talk to your brother about his former employer, Mr. Gilmore.
And the, uh, unfortunate condition that he's found himself in.
Well, yeah, you know, that's just, uh...
That's, like, chemicals.
"Chemicals"?
Well, yeah, you know, like people store weird chemicals, like...
Like my brother, one time he smelled this weird smell.
You know, it was just a guy with a meth lab,
you know, like in one of the storage units.
That's probably something you guys should look into.
I'm gonna get going. So I'm gonna go. Okay.
Okay.
Now I see what's going on here.
According to Gilmore, he was standing right where I am when it happened.
Well, I don't smell any weird chemical smells.
You still have both your lips.
Apparently everything is left as it was.
Hey. 1978.
It's been a long time since any of this stuff has seen the light of day.
That's too bad, Mulder. Underneath all this dust,
this furniture is really wonderful.
Oh, well, you want to hit some yard sales while we're out here?
Mulder, this furniture is expensive. Very expensive.
- What's your point? - My point is that...
there's a lot of money sitting around here, and maybe something's missing.
- Like what? - I don't know. Jewelry.
Anson Stokes opened up the storage unit, and then he just disappeared.
There's your crime... theft.
Still doesn't explain what happened to Gilmore.
Hey, Scully, check this out.
- Ouch. - This woman look familiar to you?
- That's the woman from the trailer. - It's the young woman from the trailer.
How many centuries now has disco been dead?
Two down. Two down, I got nothing to show for it.
You got the boat.
And what the hell good is that? Huh?
That thing is like a big... You know, a big...
- White elephant? - What? I'm sorry. What does that mean?
So what the hell did you give it to me for?
- Because you asked for it. - All right. I can appreciate that.
But don't you think maybe you could've found some fricking water to put it in?
That is a given.! Fricking white elephant.
I can't even pay the taxes on it.
Why don't you just use your last wish to get rid of it?
You want me to put you in a home or something maybe?
Because I just told you, Leslie, that I wasted two wishes, okay?
Are you listening? I am not gonna waste the third, all right? Come on.
Come on! I gotta concentrate here. Let me figure this out.
Third wish, third wish. Final wish. I'm just spitballing here.
If I happen to say "I wish" by accident, that does not count.
Not until I am absolutely ready, okay?
You could always give that guy his mouth back.
All I said is that I wish Jay would shut the hell up.
If you feel bad about what you did to him, fix it on your own dime, okay?
- It doesn't work like that. - Whatever.
- Leslie, would you help me out here? - Um, money.
- Yeah. Okay, that's not bad. - Wish for money.
But don't you think we should think of something that would...
generate money instead of the actual money itself?
Brains? Talent? Hard work?
Uhhh, a money machine.
Okay, that's not... But something better. Something better.
Okay. But I just...
- An infinite number of wishes. - Okay!
Just three, boys. Settle down.
Damn it, this is hard!
You know, I have a thought.
- Granted it's pretty obvious. - What, what, what, what, what?
- What? - What?
- Seriously, what? - Oh, forget it!
- I got it. I got it. - Yeah?
I got it, I got it, I got it. Okay, are you ready? Because I am ready.
I am absolutely ready. Okay, here it goes.
I wish that I could turn invisible... at will.
- You're kidding. - No, no, this is perfect.
Yeah, I can have an advantage that nobody else on Earth can have.
I can, um, you know, spy and learn secret information. Pick up stock tips.!
- Sneak into a women's locker room? - Not just that, okay?
I'm talking about James Bond-type stuff, you know?
Your wish is breathtaking in its unoriginality.
You don't have to like it, all right? You just have to do it, right?
Done.
Son of a...
Screw it!
Oh, God. Turn invisible, please.
Yes.!
Oh, man, this is awesome.! Hey, hey, hey, brother.
Hey, Leslie, I'm over here. I'm over here.
Can you see me?
Whoa.! Aah.! Damn it.!
- Anson, are you all right? - Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
I can't see my damn feet.
Look out, world, here I come.!
I'm invisible.! Invisible, baby.! Whoo.!
- Whoo-hoo! - Yes.!
You can't see me, can you?
- I... Whoo!
Hey, uh...
Get out of my way, birds.
Oh. Well, hello, ladies.
Here comes Anson. That's right.
Come on. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Change, change.
All right. Here we go.
Need a little roadside assistance, do you?
Not to worry. Here comes Anson.
Whoa!
Can we go now?
I think you missed a spot here.
I can see straight through to his ass.
This is Anson Stokes, huh?
It is.
His dental records are a match.
He was found about a half mile from his house.
He was probably hit by a car or a truck or something.
And he's invisible.
Yes, he is.
Wow.
but this... this takes the cake.
It's... It's gonna change the boundaries of science.
It is amazing, but I don't think it has anything to do with science.
Remember Mr. Saturday Night Fever?
- Yeah. - I did a little background checking.
His real name is Henry Flanken.
He redefined the term "overnight success."
In 1977, his net worth was 36,000 dollars.
And in 1978, it was 30 million dollars.
Then there is the interesting way in which Mr. Flanken died.
How's that?
Chronic morbid tumescence.
- You don't mean what I think you mean? - Schwing!
On April 4, 1978, he was admitted to Gateway Memorial Hospital...
with an extreme priapic condition.
Apparently he was quite the specimen.
Well, what does any of that have to do with this?
Well, I think our mystery woman is the link,
about whom I can find no information whatsoever.
I-I don't know,
but we need to talk to her.
Uh, I think I should stay here with the body. I mean, I... You know...
I don't think it's a good idea to leave him unguarded.
This is truly amazing.
Okay.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
- Anson didn't suffer, did he? - No, I don't think he suffered.
But the part about him being invisible, that doesn't, uh,
catch you off guard just a little bit?
Uh...
Leslie, there was a woman here earlier. Where is she now?
She's, uh... She's gone.
Let me tell you where I'm going with this. I think that woman is a Jinniyah.
- Are you familiar with that term? - No.
It's the feminine for "genie," as in...
a demon or spirit from Middle Eastern folklore?
Yeah, except Barbara Eden never killed anybody.
but take human form.
They can perform certain tasks or grant certain wishes.
Leslie, I believe your brother found just such an object...
in the storage facility, didn't he?
He took possession of theJinniyah,
and he made some pretty outrageous requests,
likeJay Gilmore's mouth and that yacht out in the driveway.
Wait, wait. You believe all that?
I do.
And Leslie, for your own safety,
so that what happened to your brother doesn't happen to you,
I think you should hand over that object to me right now.
You're doing the right thing.
Scully, come check this out.
Come on. He's not going anywhere. Come on.
Bye.
I have a group of researchers flying in from Harvard Medical.
I can't wait to see their faces.
- What's this? - It's not what I hoped it would be,
judging from the odor coming from inside.
I think it's where the Stokes brothers keep their weed.
But that's not what I wanted to show you.
- Recognize him? How about her? - Benito Mussolini.
Your mystery woman or someone who looks a lot like her.
The computer says it is her.
I ran her through Quantico's facial recognition software...
and couldn't come up with a match in the known-felon database.
Then I took a flyer and checked with the image bank at the National Archives.
- Voila. - Well, even if it is her,
Mulder, what would she be doing with Mussolini?
Or Richard Nixon, for that matter.
I don't know, except that they're both men...
who got all the power they ever wished for and then lost it.
See? I told you it'd look good in here.
Nice rug. How do you breathe in that thing?
Can we just get this over with, please?
I've gotta be smarter than Anson was. Damn it, Anson.
Then can I once again offer you a suggestion?
Hmm.
- What? - This!
Your disability?
There was some tragedy involved here I assume.
Well, yeah, it was pretty tragic, I guess.
Me and Anson were playing mailbox baseball.
God, I miss that. And Anson's driving.
I was leaning pretty far out the window there.
Oh...
You mean this!
Yeah, you're right.
I could wish for a solid gold wheelchair.
Man, that'd be sweet. I see what you're saying. But you know what?
There's something I want more than that.
You're not gonna believe your eyes.
I certainly didn't. You ready?
Oh, he's, uh...
He is invisible, after all. Um...
He's in there.
Okay. You know what? He's creeping me out.
This isn't what I asked for. He's all weird and messed up.
I asked you to bring him back to normal.
- You asked me to bring him back. - Okay, you know, this...
Now he's starting to smell bad! This isn't what I wanted!
He's gotta at least be able to talk. You know what? That's my next wish.
Yes, I do, and that's final! I wish Anson could talk!
Done.
I should just shoot myself.
Oh!
I was so happy. I was so excited.
What was I thinking? An invisible man?
You saw it. It was real.
I don't know what I saw, Mulder. I'm...
I do know that having that kind of proof in my hands,
it was just too good to be true.
I don't think that's why the body disappeared.
Why did the body disappear?
I think it was a result of a wish being granted.
A wish? Whose wish?
Who would want Anson Stokes back? I mean, really, really back?
His brother, Leslie?
Well, this is no good!
What did you do to me?
You're back from the dead, man! What kind of gratitude is that?
What did you do to me?
I wasted two wishes on you, that's what I did!
I can't feel my heart.
I... I can't feel my blood.
I am yellow!
I'm cold. I'm cold.
- You know what? Screw this. - I'm cold.
- I'm cold. - I wasted two wishes on you...
and a perfectly good bowl of cornflakes.
There, I turned the heat up! Are you happy now, huh? Are you happy?
Is there anything else I can do for you there, buddy?
What do you say? Maybe wipe your little yellow butt?
Thanks for nothing.
You wanna make your third wish, champ?
I'd like to get out of here before the blowflies hatch.
Yeah, I tell you what. My last wish is gonna be for me, okay?
It's gonna be for me. You hear that, Anson?
I wasted two wishes on you, and you don't even give a damn about that.!
Okay. All right. Third wish.
Let's see. I could wish for, uh...
I could wish for money.
Everybody wishes for money.
Um... There's the invisibility thing.
I guess that turned out pretty stupid, though, huh, Anson? To be invisible!
That was real smart, huh?
Uh, X-ray eyes, maybe. No, that isn't it.
Like you said, solid gold wheelchair.
- Uh...
Wait, I got it. Legs!
Would you mind removing your eyewear, ma'am?
Do you have a name?
Not for a long time, now.
How about if I call you Jenn? That's short forJinniyah.
The, uh, fire department just recovered two bodies.
- Leslie Stokes and his brother Anson? - Looks like it.
And, uh, Anson Stokes is visible now, of course.
But what I'd really love an explanation for...
is how his corpse got from my locked morgue...
all the way across town to the Mark Twain Trailer Park.
Ask him. He's got it all figured out.
I know what he'd say. He'd say that you're some kind of a genie...
from a Thousand and One Nights or something like that...
- And that you grant people wishes. - There you have it.
Everybody you come in contact with seems to meet a bad end.
That's the conclusion you've drawn? That I'm evil?
Well, possibly evil. Possibly cursed. A curse to others.
The only thing you people are cursed with is stupidity.
All of you. Everybody.
Mankind. Everyone I have ever come into contact with without fail.
Always asking for the wrong thing.
- You mean making the wrong wishes? - Yeah.
It's always, "Give me money.
Give me big boobs. Give me a big hoo-hoo.
Make me cool like the Fonz. "
So what? In 500 years, people have not changed a bit.
Five hundred years?
Granted they smell better now, generally speaking.
But human greed still reigns...
shallowness, a propensity for self-destruction.
You're saying that you have been a firsthand witness...
to 500 years of human history?
I used to be human.
I was born in 15th century France.
And then one day an old Moor came to my village peddling rugs.
A very powerful class of genie.
He offered me three wishes. For the first, I asked for a stouthearted mule.
For the second, uh, a magic sack that was always full of turnips.
Did I mention this was 15th century France?
What was your third wish?
My third... I pondered for a great while.
I didn't want to waste it.
So finally, feeling very intelligent, I spoke up, and I said...
"I wish for great power and long life."
And thus became a genie yourself.
Gave me the mark of theJinn... right there.
It's forever. Sort of like a prison tattoo.
I should've been more specific.
So am I under arrest?
I can't think of anything we have to hold you on.
Not surprisingly, we don't have any evidence of any of this,
so, uh, I think she's free to go.
No, I'm not. He unrolled me.
I get three wishes.
So, your partner left the airport rather quickly.
I don't think she likes me very much.
Oh, well, I don't think she knows what to make of you.
- I don't... think I do either, really.
Well, you could always give up your three wishes.
I'll disappear. No hard feelings.
- I didn't think so. So what's your first wish?
Well... W-W...
What would your wish be if-if you were in my place?
I'm not you. It doesn't matter.
No, but, you know, I just... I'd like to know.
I'd...
wish that I never heard the word "wish" before.
I'd wish that I could live my life moment by moment,
enjoying it for what it is instead of...
instead of worrying about what it isn't.
I'd sit down somewhere with a great cup of coffee,
and I'd watch the world go by.
But then again, I'm not you.
So I doubt that's your wish.
You know, I think I'm beginning to see the problem here.
You say that most people make the wrong wishes, right?
Without fail. It's like giving a chimpanzee a revolver.
This is because they make their wishes solely for personal gain.
- Could be. - So the trick would be...
to make a wish that's totally altruistic, that's for everyone.
So, um,
I wish for peace on Earth.
Peace on Earth. That's it?
What the hell's wrong with that? You can't do it?
No. I can.
- It's done.
Oh, crap.
I guess I should have seen this coming!
Scully.
Scully?
Hello?
Hello!
Very good. Genie!
Listen.
You know damn well that's not what I meant.
You don't have to wipe out the entire population of the whole planet...
just to affect a little peace on Earth and goodwill towards men.
Mmm, you didn't say, "Goodwill towards men."
So you expect me to change the hearts of six billion people?
No religion in history's been able to pull that off.
Not Allah or Buddha or Christ.
But you'd like me to do that in your name?
So... what, you can feel real good about yourself?
D-Did I say that? I... I didn't say that.
Mmm, how grotesquely egotistical of you.
I bet you wish you hadn't made your first wish.
Yes, I do, since you butchered the intent of that wish so completely.
And another thing. I think you've got a really horrible attitude.
I guess that comes from being rolled up in a rug for the last 500 years.
But we're not all that stupid. We're not all chimpanzees with revolvers.
Agent Mulder?
Sir.
How did you get in here?
Uh...
"Whereas, I have one wish left...
and desire to use it most effectively for the good of all mankind..."
yadda, yadda, yadda... "here on this plane of existence. "
Hmm.
What, are you a lawyer?
Well, I have to be with you.
I'm gonna get this last wish perfect. I'm not gonna leave you any loopholes.
or to make everyone's eyes grow on stalks.
Oh, geez. And I was so looking forward to that.
Skinner called me, Mulder. Is everything all right?
You don't remember disappearing...
off the face of the earth for about an hour this morning?
No.
Then I guess everything's okay.
Mul...
Could you give us a minute, please?
Sure.
Like today?
Wh...
- Where the hell'd she go? - Boink!
No. It's gotta...
It's gotta be hypnotism or mesmerism or something.
Scully, it is what it is. You examined an invisible body, remember?
- I thought I did. - Oh!
Mulder, all right. Say...
Say that you're right. Say this is what it is.
No, no, the trick is to be specific, to make the wish perfect.
That way everyone is gonna benefit.
It's gonna be a safer world, a happier world.
There's gonna be food for everyone, freedom for everyone,
the end of tyranny of the powerful over the weak.
- Am I leaving anything out? - It sounds wonderful.
- Then what's the problem? - Maybe it's the whole point...
of our lives here, Mulder, to achieve that.
I mean, maybe it's a process...
that one man shouldn't try and circumvent with a single wish.
You ready?
Yeah, I'm ready.
I can't believe you don't want butter on your popcorn.
Ew. It's un-American.
- Caddyshack, Mulder?
- It's a classic American movie.
That's what every guy says. It's a guy movie.
Okay, when you invite me over to your place, we can watch Steel Magnolias.
- So, um, what's the occasion?
I don't know. It just... felt like the thing to do.
- Cheers. - Cheers.
I don't know if you noticed, but, um,
I never made the world a happier place.
Well, I'm fairly happy.
That's something.
And now our feature presentation.
So what was your final wish anyway?
I'm all right
Here you go.

- T-minus ten seconds to engagement.
Yaaah! Whoo-hoo!
Whoo! Lo-Fat's goin'off!
- Gotta kill! Gotta kill. - Stay out of my way, geeks.
Come the next level, I'm a death machine.
Whoo! Yeah!
Status: combat ready.
Situation: Guerrilla units in the immediate vicinity...
of insertion module.
Whoo! Yeah!
- Let's do this! - Bring it on!
- T-minus ten, nine, - Look at these heart rates.
- Five, four, - Come on! Yeah!
three, two,
one.
- Engage. - Whoo!
Do you see 'em?
They're out there, geeks, looking to fry your huevos.
Call it, Retro! Call it!
Now!
Whoa! It's a total massacre out there.
Phase two, geeks.
- Ready, knuckleheads? - Flank right!
- Flank left! - Go!
Lo-Fat's down.
- You got me, Moxie? - Got you covered.
- Retro's in. - Adrenaline redline.
The blood thirst is unquenchable.
Moxie? Who's there?
Who are you?
I am Maitreya. This is my game.
Agents Mulder and Scully. F.B.I. We're expected.
I need to scan your I.D.
Retina scan, please.
Cool.
Ma'am?
I'll need you to look over those nondisclosure agreements.
"To protect all proprietary or intellectual property...
"owned by FPS, a private California corporation,
under the harshest penalty of the law."
Signature at the bottom, please.
- FPS. - First Person Shooter.
- Video games. - Digital entertainment.
I can get into the Pentagon easier than this.
Dudes! Agent Mulder, what's up, wild man?
Welcome to the land where silicon meets silicone.
Can I get you a latte from the bar, or perhaps a bottle of designer H2O?
Scully?
How 'bout a simple explanation as to why we're here?
Why don't we take a brief moment to feel the pulse of the new American gold rush?
You're standing on the launch pad of a rocket headed for the stars.
Okay.
There's been a little accident.
What kind of accident?
Like an industrial accident.
- How did the victim die? - It's not exactly clear.
- Right. - Was there equipment involved?
- No. - Yes.
- Yes and no. - What's your business here?
- Our business? - Yeah.
We're... We're consultants to FPS.
Langly did some programming for them.
- He created all of the bad guys. - Only the Euro-goons.
We don't want to give you the idea that we're major profit participants.
Cash or stock options?
Options. Preferred rate.
Vested immediately with a short-term exercise against venture collateral...
to bypass S.E.C. regs.
- The I.P.O. 's in a week. - Game ships on Friday.
Fifty malls across the United States and Japan.
Only there's a dead body between you and untold riches.
I don't know about you guys, but I'd be checking my shorts for cake.
- This man's been shot. - No!
See, when somebody is shot, there's a gun involved, right?
What do you call this?
That's a laser blaster for wasting cyber-trash.
- It emits a low-frequency... - Just let me! All right.
The weapons feed off the FPS mainframe.
The effect is intensely real, but harmless.
You say this weapon is a toy, but this man clearly has gunshot wounds...
- Through his... - Stun suit.
It's rigged with paint for wounds and kill shots.
Total bleeding-edge technology.
- He's dead. I got it. - Who was he playing against?
Against the game. You waste the cyber-thugs before they waste you.
It's all about body count.
But they're computer-generated images...
running on a projector.
It all happens in the game space.
It's a total digital environment.
Nothing's real. It's all virtual.
Did anybody see what happened?
I was in the control booth with Ivan.
Retro was in the zone. His telemetry was solid.
He looked unstoppable, like he was on his way to the next level,
when suddenly he was cooked meat.
Well, the next call's gonna be to the local P.D.
No cops! No cops. You said no cops.
You said you had connections.
Connections or not, you've got a murder victim here.
Headlines!
Just what the Wall Street money dudes want to read as we're goin' to market.
Just what the Wall Street money dudes want to read as we're goin' to market.
Yes, this is Special Agent Dana Scully with the F.B.I.
You said you were in the control booth when it happened?
Can you tell me exactly what you saw?
-  I'm still not sure if we even saw it.
I mean, one minute everything was going perfect, and then we crashed.
Ivan and I were sitting here. We both just looked at each other.
It happened so fast.
And then "goosh," Retro's vitals spike like he's been shot.
And the system defaults.
And they're right back in the game space.
Lo-Fat, get over here! What happened?
Retro? What's wrong?
- Lights out. Game over. - What's wrong, man? What happened?
What happened in there?
We don't know. There's no res images on interior game spaces.
What about the wire frame?
Maybe I can.
I'll strip down to wire frame display.
Um, I mean... we've never mapped this area before.
Retro was in noncombat space.
- It's a chick. - It can't be.
Can you texture-wrap her?
- Holy Toledo! - She's packin' a flintlock.
That ain't all she's packin'. Can you print that out for me?
Goddess.
Let me get this straight, Agent Scully.
You got no murder weapon, no forensic evidence,
no motive, no suspect.
Scully.
My partner Agent Mulder. This is Detective Lacoeur.
- Have you got something? - Yeah, our killer, I believe.
Hey, I'll put out an A.P.B. for Frederick's of Hollywood.
Mulder, you're not serious.
It's all in the computer.
Mulder, that's any voluptuous vixen out of any number of video games.
She's not in "any video game." She's in this one, and no one programmed her in.
Yeah, but even if they had, she's not real.
She's a character. She's-She's some immature, hormonal fantasy.
Darryl Musashi. You see who that is?
- Darryl Musashi. - As I live and breathe.
- Who's Darryl Musashi? - The O.G.
Original Guru.
Word is he slums as a game designer when he's not contracted to the C.I.A.
- The boy wonder of virtual mayhem. - What's he doing here?
Ivan must have called him to go in and slay the ninja babe.
Mulder, why does this game have the effect...
of reducing grown men back to moony adolescence?
That's Darryl Musashi!
Mulder.
- Huh. - Do you want me to autopsy the body?
Emerging module into set mode. T-minus 20 seconds.
Pay attention, worms.
Darryl Musashi's gonna show us how this game's supposed to be played.
I heard he scored 90 consecutive wins on Demon Space Drifter.
- Ninety-one. - Look at him. The man's a sphinx.
- T-minus ten,
nine, eight,
seven, six,
five, four,
three, two, one.
Engage.
Hey, Byers, you gotta see this. Mulder, get over here.
- Is that him? Is that Darryl Musashi? - Yeah, that's him.
He just stepped into the game.
- Why is he just standing there? - Because he knows no fear.
- Yeah! - Unbelievable.
- Standing heart rate is 68. - He hasn't even broken a sweat.
What just happened?
She cut off his hands.
Preliminary external examination of deceased,
a 20-ish male, name listed only as "Retro,"
offers no additional clues as to actual cause of death.
Scratch that.
Cause of death is from a large entry wound at the sternum...
resulting in trauma to the internal organs...
and blood loss.
Wound is consistent with a high-velocity impact...
from a large projectile...
which passed through a three-ply Kevlar jacket.
Scratch that.
Wound is the result of high-velocity impact...
from an unknown object...
which, even if it did enter the body,
left no damn trace evidence whatsoever.
No powder burns, no chemical signatures...
of any kind of explosive propellant.
- No luck? - I thought I was on to something.
You know, Mulder, this suit holds more than just exploding paint cells.
and then sends that information back to the computer.
Then when a player is shot, a battery pack sends a 12-volt jolt...
that keeps him from getting up until the game is over.
Virtual death.
Yeah. Well, if only that were the case.
that one of the charges had blown inward.
But unfortunately, that wasn't the case either.
I've got a birthday coming up.
You have to admit, though, Scully, this is a pretty amazing piece of technology.
- Yeah. Wasted on a stupid game. - Stupid?
Dressing up like high-tech warriors...
to play a futuristic version of cowboys and Indians.
What kind of moron gets his ya-yas out like that?
Mulder, what purpose does this game serve...
- Who says it adds to it? - You think that taking up weapons...
and creating gratuitous virtual mayhem...
has any redeeming value whatsoever?
That the testosterone frenzy that it creates stops when the game does?
That's rather sexist, isn't it?
I mean, maybe the game provides an outlet for certain impulses,
that it fills a void in our genetic makeup...
that the more civilizing effects of society fail to provide for us.
That must be why men feel the great need to blast the crap out of stuff.
Well, testosterone frenzy or no,
the only suspect we have in this man's murder is a woman.
Yeah, I've seen it.
A computer-animated woman, Mulder,
with a computer-animated weapon.
A flintlock pistol, which would leave a very large entry wound.
Pictures don't kill people. Guns kill people.
As do swords.
The world-renowned Darryl Musashi.
Mulder.
You're kidding.
- Thanks.
L.A. Sheriff s Department just picked up a female suspect for the murders.
Who's the man? He's the man.
He's the man with the badge!
You get the feeling these men have something better to do?
I mean, is that legal?
Uh, we picked her up outside of a strip club in Reseda.
Fits your description to a "T."
- Was she read her rights? - About 500 times.
- Oh, yeah.
For the record, can you state your name, please?
For the record, can you state your name, please?
For the record again, my name is Jade Blue Afterglow. I reside...
- I'm sorry. Your real name? - That is my real name.
What were you expecting? Mildred?
No.
I sure seem to be upsetting a lot of people around here.
Well, you're not upsetting me, Miss, uh...
Afterglow.
I sure upset the man running the metal detector.
You say that you have no knowledge of Ivan Martinez...
or a company known as First Person Shooter, or FPS.
I meet a lot of men.
Would it surprise you to know that you have been placed at a crime scene...
in the offices of FPS?
Let's just say it takes a whole lot to surprise me.
You might want to start telling the truth.
And what truth am I not telling you?
That you murdered two men,
one with a 14th-century broadsword,
and the other with a flintlock pistol.
Oh. You must have had me confused with my sister.
Xena, warrior princess.
Are you denying that this is you?
- Now I get it. - What?
The medical imaging place in Culver City.
I got paid to let them do this body-scan thing.
They paid you to scan your body?
You think that's the strangest thing I've been paid to do?
We're very sorry, Miss Afterglow, but...
Uh, we're sorry. You're free to go.
I don't know about you, Scully, but I am feeling the great need...
to blast the crap out of something.
- Hello? - Anybody here?
Phoebe?
Hey, you okay?
Boy, I must have fell asleep.
I was just thinking of taking a nap.
I've been up for 70 hours straight analyzing code,
trying to fix the game.
- Where is everybody? Where's Ivan? - Um, he's with the money guys.
They're all freaking.
We need to talk to him right away about a woman named Jade Blue Afterglow.
He scanned her body and he created the character out of her.
- He put her in the game. - Hey, what are they doing?
Oh.
The Lone Gunmen are on the floor.
Langly and I wrote a software patch.
To bypass the problem.
- Hey. - What just happened?
Oh, I don't know.
- They're in the game. - Hey, Phoebe, are you paying attention?
You're supposed to wait until we said we were ready.
What the hell's going on?
Phoebe, come on.
- What's happening? - Anyone up there running the program?
I don't believe this. The program's running itself.
- Phoebe! - This can't be happening.
Somebody's shooting at them.
They need help.
Mulder!
Nine, eight, seven,
six, five,
four, three,
two, one.
- Engage. - Bring it on.
- You guys okay? - We've been better.
- Byers has been hit. - I'm okay. It's a flesh wound.
It's her. She's out there.
She nailed Byers with that flintlock.
Okay, on the count of three, I'm gonna lay down some cover, fellas.
You ready?
One,
two, three.
Mulder!
Get in the module!
- What is he doing? - Don't go after her! Get back here!
- He's getting his ya-yas out. - We're not defaulting the program!
- Mulder! - It's suicide!
Put the sword down.
Mulder?
- Oh, no.
Where's Mulder?
I said, where's Mulder?
Maybe you guys didn't hear me. Come on, guys. Where is he?
We don't know. He just took off after her.
- He was firing his weapon. - I saw where he went!
I want to know where he is.
Is there a door or an exit or some kind of passageway that he could have used?
Just the one you came in.
- It's just a game. - Yeah.
- Easy for you to say. -  Agent Scully!
I found him.
This monitors everyone playing the game. There... player four.
- It's his telemetry. - What do you mean?
Player four. That's him.
- On the monitor. - Right there.
- Where? - That's Mulder.
- He's alive. - Those are his vitals.
- He's still in the game. - Yes, but where's the game?
Frohike!
Langly!
Byers!
- I think that's it. - Yeah.
- What are you doing? - We're rerouting the circuitry.
I mean, it won't work. There's no way to do that.
We are back in business! Baby, you are dope.
What?
We were toast. I felt the flames licking my ass.
Then the bankers saw the letters on the autopsy..."F.B.I.
Cause of death: unknown."
Yeah, and you're gonna be countin' teeth.
- Her partner's lost in the game. - Lost?
- The game has disappeared. - What are you talking about?
Jade Blue Afterglow. Does that ring a bell?
Jade Blue Afterglow?
- Oh, you'd remember her.
Hey! Phoebe!
I don't know how it happened.
You knew about her?
Then it was you. You scanned that woman's body.
Into my computer.
She was my creation. She was mine.
- But why? - You don't know what it's like...
day in and day out, choking in a haze of rampant testosterone.
I wouldn't be so sure.
I mean, she was all I had to keep me sane,
my only way to strike back as a woman.
She was my goddess, everything I can never be.
But, Phoebe, she is still a killer.
I can't explain it, but she is, and you put her in that game.
No, I didn't.
I was creating my own game in my own computer.
It was totally secret. I never told anyone.
But somehow she jumped programs,
and she's feeding off the male aggression.
It's making her stronger and stronger.
I need your help.
You're the only one who can understand.
- You've got to destroy her, Phoebe. - I don't know how.
Well, there's got to be some way.
There's got to be some vulnerability or a weakness somewhere.
She has no weakness anymore.
Hey!
Bet you think you're gonna kick my butt up and down the block.
Okay.
Her name is Maitreya.
- Maitreya? - She's input herself into the game.
- We have to download her. - We can't even get on-line.
- The system's been hijacked. - The program won't respond.
Frohike, what's wrong?
- What is that? - Mulder's vitals are wiggy.
- What? - They're all over the map.
This is your fault.
- You put her here. - Hey!
No fair pickin' on a girl.
We're back on-line.
- There's no picture. - No, we're just in res-up.
No, there's something wrong.
- That's not the game. - Yes, it is. It's level two.
- How did that happen? - Where's Mulder?
Mulder's in level one.
-  No, he's right there. - Shut the game down.
No, no. No, no. I can't.
- Well, just turn it off. -  Power down, Langly.
- The computer's not responding. - Look, we have to get him out of there!
Yeah, and quick.
Whoa! Stop right there!
That's not really fair, is it?
Well, that's just cheating.
- Go, girl! - Scully's on fire!
- The blood thirst in unquenchable! - Are you witnessing this?
- Oh, yeah. - Scully's in the zone!
- Clearly. - What's wrong?
This is level two. It only gets harder.
No one's ever beaten level two.
- Are you okay? - Ask me if I'm humiliated.
Mulder.
-  This is nuts! - They'll never make it.
- My whole life is in this game! - What are you trying to do?
- Stay out of this! - She's gonna destroy it.
- It's the only way to save them. - Let it go, both of you!
- You can save them? - There's a kill command.
- It kills the whole game. - You knew about this?
- She knew about it too. - You said it wouldn't work.
She was trying to save her creation, her goddess.
You don't care who dies as long as your game survives.
- Our friends are in there. - And we're not gonna let them die.
Mulder?
Give me that! This is out of your hands now.
- Shut down the program. - You're the only ones that can do it.
- They can't keep this up. - Scully's running out of ammo.
- What's the command? - Don't do it, Phoebe.
We're so close.
- The command. - Give it to him.
Shift-Alt-Blood Bath.
Oh, my God.
We killed the game, and Mulder and Scully along with it.
Over here!
- Scully! - Mulder!
Scully!
That's entertainment!
We came, we saw, we conquered.
And if the taste of victory is sweet,
the taste of virtual victory is not Sweet 'N Low,
nor the bullets made of sugar.
Maybe out past where the imagination ends, our true natures lie,
waiting to be confronted on their own terms.
Out where the intellect is at war with the primitive brain...
in the hostile territory of the digital world...
where laws are silent and rules disappear in the midst of arms.
Born in anarchy, with an unquenchable blood thirst,
we shudder to think what might rise up from the darkness.

We're so sorry, Becky.
If there's anything we can do for you,
anything at all, just let us know.
Thank you so much.
That would have meant a lot to him.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you for coming.
Mrs. Crouch,
I'm sorry for your loss.
Thank you, Mr...
Johnson.
I worked briefly with your husband.
I was impressed by him... very much so.
Thank you.
Sorry.
Hell of a Christmas, Raymond.
He's at peace now.
That's one small comfort to be drawn.
He didn't even leave a note.
"I am the resurrection and the life.
"He that believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.
And whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die."
"I am the resurrection and the life.
"He that believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.
And whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die."
"I am the resurrection and the life.
"He that believeth in Me...
"though he were dead, yet shall he live.
'And whosoever liveth and believeth in Me...
shall never die."
- "I am the resurrection and the life.
"He that believeth in Me...
"though he were dead, yet shall he live.
"And whosoever liveth and believeth in Me...
shall never die."
"He that believeth in Me, though he were dead,
yet shall he live."
- Yeah, four units and...
Thank you, ma'am.
- Are you with the F.B.I. too? - Yes, sir.
Look, I know my job. The man was deceased.
- I'm sorry? - I understand...
that he was one of your own.
But these rumors I'm hearing that I put a living human being into the ground?
You people better get your facts straight real fast.
Mulder? You been spreading rumors?
Why? You hear any good ones lately?
- Not particularly.
So what do you have here?
Merry Christmas, by the way, Scully.
Thank you. Merry Christmas to you too.
Grave robbery with a twist.
Check out the headliner, Scully.
Well, it looks like someone on the inside was trying to get out.
Indeed it does. And to answer your question,
no, I haven't been spreading any rumors.
The local P.D. 's been doing a pretty good job of that,
ever since they matched the fingerprints on the dead man to these.
And to those up there on that headstone.
There's a big juicy handprint on the back.
What about the person, or persons, who did the digging?
Well, we've got one pile of dirt.
I'm guessing one man with a shovel.
Other than that, last night's rain hasn't left us much to go on.
Well, go ahead, Scully. Nay say me.
The body of an F.B.I. agent gets disinterred,
only to climb out on its own and disappear into the Yuletide night.
- See, you had me up until there. - Did I?
I think it's what you said before. I think it's a grave robbery with a twist.
You've got the fingerprints and the torn casket liner.
Most likely, it's rigged evidence that's been faked by whoever exhumed the body.
- Faked for what effect? - Publicity.
Fear. Rumors. I mean, I don't know what specific effect,
but nonetheless, it's...
- What? - Looks like blood.
"And whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die."
"I am the resurrection and the life.
"He that believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.
And whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die."
"I am the resurrection and the life.
"He that believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.
And whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die."
"I am the resurrection and the life."
Special Agent Raymond Crouch.
Age 56. Married, no children.
After a sterling 21-year career with the Bureau,
he retired in 1993.
And then earlier this month,
he was found in the garage of his Tallahassee home,
service weapon in hand.
Definitely self-inflicted?
I read over the report, and there's no indication otherwise.
How about a motive for the grave robberies?
Well, we've gone through all the cases Crouch had a hand in,
and he doesn't seem to have made any enemies.
Same thing with his personal life.
No large debts, no feuds with neighbors,
never a bad word against him.
- Nothing stands out? - Should something stand out?
Agent Mulder, what's your take on this?
Well, only that I don't think it was grave robbery per se.
It was necromancy... the summoning of the dead.
It's a form of magic dating back to primitive shamanism...
with a long tradition in the Christian Church.
Through it, the dead are brought back to life for the purposes...
of divulging arcane knowledge or performing ritual tasks.
So that's what this wacko thought he was doing... raising the dead?
That's what he was doing. This is a, uh...
That's a magic circle drawn in goats'blood.
The rain washed most of it away.
The blood attracts the spirits of the undead,
while the circle focuses the necromancer's power...
while protecting him from the spirits that he's conjuring.
Okay.
You would not want to be this man's dry cleaner.
Obviously, there are clear ritualistic elements to this crime.
But the question is, why were they directed at Raymond Crouch?
That is the question.
Well, let's come up with an answer.
Mulder, Scully, a word, please?
Necromancy aside, this magic circle you mentioned,
what if it looks something like this?
It's an oroboros. Possibly.
Definitely a mystical symbol. The alchemists favored it.
They believe that it represented all of existence.
I'm thinking more of the Millennium Group.
It was their symbol as well. Are you familiar with them?
Yeah, somewhat. They were, uh,
former F.B.I. agents who offered consulting services to law enforcement.
Somehow, they fell into disrepute.
They operated in extreme secrecy.
Rumors abounded that they had their own agenda,
which was less than altruistic, if not improper or illegal.
That it was, in fact, a cult based upon...
Judeo-Christian End Time prophecies...
concerning the coming millennium.
- Was Raymond Crouch a member? - I can't seem to find out.
Apparently, the group dissolved several months ago.
They left no paper trail, nothing.
However,
Long Island, Northern California, Arizona.
All three graves contained the bodies of former F.B.I. agents.
All three were recent suicides.
How long were you gonna sit on this?
Owing to the Millennium Group's former ties with the Bureau,
this matter is sensitive, to say the least.
Investigate them. Keep a low profile.
I think I know where to start.
- How well do you know this man? - Only by reputation.
- He left VICAP before I got there.
- What's he doing here? - Good morning.
Apparently, he, uh, checked himself in for a 30-day observation.
I gather the last few years haven't been very kind to him.
But if there's anybody that can tell us about the Millennium Group, it's him.
He used to consult for 'em. Later, he fought to bring 'em down...
at the expense of his own career and reputation.
Twelve yard line. They are threatening.
Frank Black?
Hi, my name is Fox Mulder. This is my partner, Dana Scully.
It's a pleasure to meet you. You mind if we sit down?
Higgins tries the middle, and he gets...
- Nowhere!
Ah, the Fighting Irish and the Golden Eagles, huh?
What can I do for you, agents?
Well, we're working on a case that, uh,
we feel that you might have some particular insight to.
The deaths of four F.B.I. agents.
- Do you recognize these men? - I do.
All four committed suicide in the last six months.
All were exhumed from their graves in a ritual desecration.
They were members of the Millennium Group. Is that correct?
Sir, we've been having a really difficult time...
gleaning any information whatsoever about the group.
About its membership, its practices.
I believe you can help us.
No, thank you. I'm retired.
I think you can tell by the circumstances...
that I'm trying to put my life back together.
I can't get involved in this.
We're not asking you to get involved.
I'm just asking you to take a look at the case file.
No, thank you.
Mr. Black, the day after tomorrow is January 1, 2000.
That's the significant date for these people.
That doesn't leave us much time.
Don't you wanna see them stopped?
Well, Mr. Black,
you are not what I was expecting.
- Agent Mulder? - Yes?
It's first and eighteen.
Just let me watch this game in peace.
It's third and ten. Notre Dame.
- Happy New Year. - Same to you.
- Evening. - Hi.
Could I, uh, give you a hand?
Oh, no, I'm about done.
But thanks. Guess I ran over a nail or something.
- Well, I can help you see, at least. - Yeah.
I've been driving all night. It'll be good to get home.
I hear ya.
Man! Whew!
- What is that? - Uh...
I think a deer maybe must've died out there in the woods.
Sir?
What's in the truck?
- Nothing. - Mind if I take a look?
There's nothing in there, so...
Drop that, take two steps back.
Drop it.
"And whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die."
"I am the resurrection and the life.
"He that believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.
And whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die."
Oh, Lord. Stand up there!
Stand up! Let me see your hands!
- What?
Speak up!
Hey.
I've got the men concentrating on the woods.
Our necromancer was definitely here.
It's salt. Heavy magic.
Well, if you're gonna tell me that he, uh,
stopped by the side of the road to raise the dead,
which I hope you're not, I've got two things to say to you.
One is that his previous circles were made of blood, not salt. And two...
And they were large enough to contain a body.
Protecting himself against what?
Whatever it was that did that.
Agents!
Over here!
I saw a lump in the ground.
My God.
Bite marks. They look human.
More salt.
"I am he that liveth and was dead.
"And behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen,
and have the keys of hell and of death."
Book of Revelations, chapter 1, verse 18.
Go Fighting Irish.
"First and eighteen. "
It's not football. It's Revelations.
You wanted to tell us something, Frank.
Why don't you just come out and say it.
I don't know what you're talking about. I told you.
- I cannot get involved in this. - Right.
So you'll occasionally drop the little arcane hint?
A police officer was murdered, Frank.
Why do you want to play around?
Your denials aside, you obviously know something about that.
You knew that we'd find this.
What are you afraid of?
Losing your daughter.
You're in a custody battle with the parents of your late wife.
I just spoke with your doctor. That's why you're here.
They claimed I was an unfit father... that I was obsessed with conspiracy,
the end of the world.
That my work meant more to me than my daughter, Jordan.
The thing is, they were right.
- And so you retired. - I will sell insurance.
but I will not mention the Millennium Group again.
But you obviously want to help.
You... dropped that clue on us.
Look, Frank, nobody needs to know about this.
We're just three people sitting around talking.
The Book of Revelations describes the end of the physical world...
in a battle between heaven and hell... good against evil.
The Millennium Group believed that that time was upon us.
These four represent a schism in the group.
They believe that for the End Time to come as it must,
man must take an active hand in bringing that about.
With the express purpose of being brought back to life.
The four horsemen of the apocalypse.
These four men bring with them...
war, pestilence, famine and death.
So that all the dead of the earth will rise.
Armageddon.
It must begin with the dawn of the millennium, or not at all.
That's what they believe.
The man you're looking for, your necromancer,
he exhumed these men in accordance with their wishes.
They sought him out.
He believes he's doing God's work.
But he's mistaken.
Could you tell us a little bit more about this man?
Well, he's a white male, 45 to 50.
He's a religious man. No police record.
No fulfilling relationship.
You would pass him without giving him a glance.
So this is the one event that will give his life meaning?
Yeah.
He needs privacy for this. He'll live alone.
Possibly in the house he grew up in.
Most likely it's a large, rural property away from prying eyes.
He'll own a truck or a van. He needs it to transport the bodies.
There'll be high fences, "No Trespassing"signs.
It's a solitary existence.
He's worked around death all his life in some capacity.
A funeral parlor or a cemetery.
- Death comforts him. A Rice County deputy missing...
He took great care in burying the deputy, in preparing the body,
despite the fact that he feared being caught.
He stapled the lips, sealed the mouth shut.
It was to prevent the man from coming back to life.
He believes that if disturbed, the deputy will rise from the dead.
It's too soon for that, which is why...
when he realizes the deputy has been discovered,
he'll feel a need to take action.
He'll return to the body the first chance he gets.
Rice County Morgue.
I think you'll catch him there.
These four members of the Millennium Group,
the ones that "truly liveth who are dead,"
there are the ones we have to catch.
- Mr. Black? - Yeah?
You've got a phone call. I think it might be your daughter.
Thank you. My daughter. Excuse me.
Mulder, you're telling me it's more important...
to track down four dead bodies than one live murderer?
He's not our murderer, and those four dead bodies aren't dead.
- And the millennium is 14 hours away.
Mulder, these people, even when they were alive,
mangled Biblical prophecy to the extent that it's unrecognizable.
And the year 2000 is just their artificial deadline.
And besides, 2001 is actually the start of the new millennium.
Nobody likes a math geek, Scully.
Anyway, I think that Frank's profile is sound.
- I do too. - And I think with it,
we have the best chance of finding this necromancer, as you call him.
So I'm going down to the county morgue.
- I absolutely think you should. - And what are you gonna do?
Follow the profile. The deputy was killed...
on a road that connects from the north with no major highway.
I'm thinking our necromancer lives nearby.
Oh, Scully, will you do me a favor?
Don't let anybody remove the staples from the deputy's mouth, okay?
Please? Just humor me? Thanks.
Proceeding with the visual examination of the mouth.
Geez.
- What appears to be salt...
is packed into the victim's mouth.
- God only knows why.
I'm removing it.
You've reached Rice County Morgue.
No one can come to the phone.
This is Agent Dana Scully with the F.B.I.
If you've already started, stop now.
I'll be there shortly, and I'll explain when I arrive.
Hello?
Where is she?
Sir?
How you feeling?
All things considered?
What the hell happened here? Who is that man?
The sheriff s deputy.
The man we found this morning.
He was dead.
And then somehow, he wasn't.
He attacked me.
You shot him?
Three rounds, center of mass into his chest.
No effect.
There's a gunshot wound to his head as well.
Yeah, this man, uh,
Mulder calls the necromancer, our suspect, he was here too.
He fired that shot with my gun.
He saved me. I have no idea why.
He got away, but I was in no shape to follow.
Look, sir,
I can't even begin to offer an explanation for what happened.
But I have to say it is exactly what Mulder feared.
Well, welcome to the boondocks.
In the sweet by and by
We will meet on that beautiful shore
Hey! Open the door! Open the door!
Open up! Let me out!
Hey!
I haven't heard from him. He didn't go to the morgue with you?
No, he went looking for our suspect's home.
No one's been able to contact him since.
I've got task force agents canvassing the northwestern Maryland area,
but it's a large territory to cover, and we're running out of time.
Sir, I'm just afraid that Mulder may have found what he's looking for.
I need your help in finding him.
I'm not sure that I really understand your reasons, sir.
Mulder mentioned the four Millennium members...
"who liveth and were dead."
Now, this morning in the morgue, I saw what he was talking about.
You did?
One of them attacked me.
I'm sorry.
Now, as crazy as this sounds, I have to ask.
Do you believe that the Millennium Group...
is actually capable of bringing about the End Time?
Armageddon?
I understand their beliefs.
I've spent years trying to unravel them,
make sense of them.
It doesn't mean I believe them myself.
But what if it were true?
Good and evil... Which would prevail?
I'm sorry.
Octavia?
I'm gonna check myself out.
- You'd like a day pass? - I won't be coming back.
Who's there?
- It's me. - You came.
I almost didn't.
We'd given up on you. Thank God.
Thank God.
There's someone in the basement. A policeman.
He killed one of the members.
He shot him in the head.
But you're here.
Now we'll have four.
I'm here.
I can't tell you how happy I am.
You were meant to be the fourth. I always knew that.
- I so hoped you'd come around. - I didn't want to.
The man in the basement... I told him how to find this place.
You... Why?
I was trying to walk the straight and narrow,
leave the Millennium Group behind.
But I know I can't do that anymore,
now that I know you've succeeded.
You didn't believe the dead would arise.
- No. - You see what the future holds, Frank.
You know you can't run from it.
No, I can't run.
You've paid so dearly. They've taken your daughter from you,
murdered your wife.
There's no justice in this world.
But there will be in the next.
The hour is near.
Are you ready, Frank?
I'm ready.
"I am the resurrection and the life.
He that believeth in Me, though he were dead..."
"...yet shall he live.
And whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die."
- Scully. - This is Skinner.
We back-checked Frank Black as you asked.
other than from his daughter.
But the staff took messages, including one from a Rice County number.
Rice County? That's where I am right now.
All four received calls from this same number in the weeks before their deaths.
I'm gonna need an address.
Don't do this. I'm begging you, please.
You know what the world is. Evil goes unpunished.
The good suffer. There's no future here but uncertainty and pain.
Let the judgment come!
- You're damning yourself, Frank! - Agent Mulder?
Can you hear me?
- Agent Mulder? -  Yeah. I'm down here.
They're all around.
- You armed? - Oh, yeah.
Shoot for the head. That seems to stop 'em. There's three more of'em.
- Where? - I don't know. They're hiding.
- Mulder, can you get up? - Uh, I think so.
- Look out!
- Look out!
Well, there's another shot...
of that beautiful millennium crystal ball all lit up.
And they're getting ready to bring in the new year.
Boy, are they packed in tonight.
The body heat alone is keeping 'em warm. And look at 'em,
all the way up past 52nd Street.
That is that X-shaped thing I was talking about before.
This is Times Square... the crossroads of the world.
- Mr. Black. - Hey.
MarkJohnson's been taken for psychiatric evaluation.
He'll be put under suicide watch, just as you asked.
- Good.
- And, um... - What?
There's someone here to see you.
- Hi, Daddy! - Hi ya, little one.
Wow.
- Oh, I missed you, sweetheart. - I missed you too, Daddy.
Let's get out of here.
Frank, good luck with everything.
Agent Mulder, Agent Scully. I guess this is it, huh?
- You're not gonna stay and watch? - No, we just wanna go home.
Take care of yourselves.
Thirty seconds now. Get ready...
for the loudest cheering you'll ever hear in your whole life.
Hug your friends and loved ones tight, and whoever that person is next to you.
No time like the present. Are you ready? Here we go.
Ten, nine, eight,
seven, six, five,
four, three, two, one!
Happy New Year 2000!
The world didn't end.
No, it didn't.
Happy New Year, Scully.
Happy New Year, Mulder.
Happy New Year!
