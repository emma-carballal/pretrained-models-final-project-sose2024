<bos>ï»¿1 Oh, my... God.<eos>
<bos>That was...<eos>
<bos>that was incredible.<eos>
<bos>I mean it.<eos>
<bos>You don't believe me.<eos>
<bos>Can you hear me?<eos>
<bos>Hey, I...<eos>
<bos>I don't even know your name.<eos>
<bos>New York businessman calls<eol>his wife to say good night,<eos>
<bos>then goes out, picks up some chippie,<eos>
<bos>brings her back here for sex.<eos>
<bos>Beyond that, well, nothing makes<eol>a whole lot of sense.<eos>
<bos>How's that?<eos>
<bos>Security monitor records the victim<eos>
<bos>entering the room with a woman at 10:13.<eos>
<bos>Same monitor records a male<eol>leaving just after midnight.<eos>
<bos>Couldn't she have changed clothes?<eos>
<bos>Thought of that. Male is<eol>definitely a different person--<eos>
<bos>short hair and at least<eol>30 pounds heavier.<eos>
<bos>The video never recorded his entry<eos>
<bos>nor the chippie ever leaving.<eos>
<bos>Well, we're 30 floors up.<eos>
<bos>No other means of egress.<eos>
<bos>Did the medical examiner<eol>establish a cause of death?<eos>
<bos>Guy blew an artery.<eos>
<bos>Must have been some roll in the hay.<eos>
<bos>It's hard to imagine,<eol>in this day and age,<eos>
<bos>someone having sex with<eol>a perfect stranger.<eos>
<bos>Any sign of robbery?<eos>
<bos>The male exited wearing<eos>
<bos>the victim's suit, carrying a suitcase,<eos>
<bos>and the wallet's gone.<eos>
<bos>You know, I don't even<eol>know why we got this call.<eos>
<bos>Really?<eos>
<bos>Somebody at the Bureau put out a memo<eos>
<bos>requesting any case<eol>involving this exact C.O.D.<eos>
<bos>I assumed it was a...<eos>
<bos>Thanks for the call.<eos>
<bos>Five deaths, four in the last six weeks<eos>
<bos>between here and Boston.<eos>
<bos>In each case the victim dies<eol>in the throes of passion.<eos>
<bos>Two women and three men,<eol>including the last one.<eos>
<bos>All young, healthy adults.<eos>
<bos>All with symptoms of<eol>massive coronary arrest.<eos>
<bos>You think there's<eol>a new drug on the streets?<eos>
<bos>The oldest drug-- not even illegal.<eos>
<bos>Each body showed the presence<eol>of huge amounts of pheromones.<eos>
<bos>The chemicals animals secrete?<eos>
<bos>You mean sexual attractants?<eos>
<bos>Radar love, only about<eol>a hundred times stronger<eos>
<bos>than found anywhere in nature.<eos>
<bos>Strong enough to produce<eos>
<bos>anaphylactic shock or a coronary.<eos>
<bos>So you think somebody<eol>is synthesizing them?<eos>
<bos>It's been done, but in nowhere<eol>near these concentrations,<eos>
<bos>and hold on to your hat, Scully,<eos>
<bos>'cause you're going to love this.<eos>
<bos>The pheromones we're talking about?<eos>
<bos>They contain human DNA.<eos>
<bos>Well, there's still a question<eos>
<bos>as to whether humans<eol>can produce pheromones,<eos>
<bos>so how can that be?<eos>
<bos>I don't know, but if it's true,<eos>
<bos>this guy's a walking aphrodisiac.<eos>
<bos>He's the ultimate sex magnet.<eos>
<bos>He or she?<eos>
<bos>You've got victims of both sexes.<eos>
<bos>Both a man and a woman<eol>on the hotel security monitor.<eos>
<bos>I know, that is a puzzle.<eos>
<bos>So, what is our profile of the killer?<eos>
<bos>Indeterminate in height, weight, sex.<eos>
<bos>Unarmed but extremely attractive.<eos>
<bos>It gets weirder.<eos>
<bos>As I said, there's been<eol>four deaths matching this M.O.<eos>
<bos>in the last six weeks.<eos>
<bos>In Boston, Hartford, Philadelphia,<eos>
<bos>and here in Washington.<eos>
<bos>The killer's moving south.<eos>
<bos>There was a death I made<eol>a note of about a year ago<eos>
<bos>with the same symptoms.<eos>
<bos>A 32-year-old U.M.W. labor organizer<eos>
<bos>was found dead outside a town<eol>called Steveston<eos>
<bos>in the woods of Massachusetts,<eos>
<bos>home to a sect of religious isolationists<eos>
<bos>called the Kindred.<eos>
<bos>Right. They live up there<eol>without electricity, phones,<eos>
<bos>any modern amenities--<eol>a lot like the Amish.<eos>
<bos>The Kindred are known<eos>
<bos>for their handmade stoneware pottery.<eos>
<bos>They mine the clay themselves<eol>in the local hills.<eos>
<bos>What's so weird about that?<eos>
<bos>The white clay in those hills<eol>is particular to that region.<eos>
<bos>It's also the same substance<eos>
<bos>I scraped out of the scratches<eol>on the latest victim's side.<eos>
<bos>Wait a minute. Aren't these people famous<eos>
<bos>for their abstinence<eol>and their pure Christian ways?<eos>
<bos>Yes, but it looks as if one<eol>of them may have forgotten<eos>
<bos>to clean under his fingernails.<eos>
<bos>I'll meet you at the market.<eos>
<bos>Hi.<eos>
<bos>Excuse me, ma'am, this is<eol>Federal Agent Scully.<eos>
<bos>I'm Agent Mulder.<eos>
<bos>We're investigating a possible murder.<eos>
<bos>Well, there aren't<eol>many killings around here.<eos>
<bos>What can you tell me about the Kindred?<eos>
<bos>They keep pretty much<eos>
<bos>to themselves, huh?<eos>
<bos>Yeah, some folks say<eol>it's 'cause they're doing<eos>
<bos>ceremonies up there--<eol>voodoo or something.<eos>
<bos>I've got nothing against them myself.<eos>
<bos>They bring in the tourists.<eos>
<bos>Did the Kindred let you<eol>take those pictures?<eos>
<bos>Oh, those-- those are<eol>from back in the '30s.<eos>
<bos>What about the missing ones?<eos>
<bos>I'm having them reframed.<eos>
<bos>They're right here under the counter.<eos>
<bos>Can I take a look at 'em?<eos>
<bos>Sure.<eos>
<bos>How would I get up to see them?<eos>
<bos>Well, they don't like<eol>strangers up there much.<eos>
<bos>The road's in pretty rough shape.<eos>
<bos>Steveston.<eos>
<bos>That's them now.<eos>
<bos>They usually shop at the feed store.<eos>
<bos>Whoa, boy.<eos>
<bos>Excuse me, ladies.<eos>
<bos>I think I'm going to go inside.<eos>
<bos>You need anything from the feed store?<eos>
<bos>Hi.<eos>
<bos>She must have problems on the asphalt.<eos>
<bos>Has she ever thrown a shoe?<eos>
<bos>What's her name?<eos>
<bos>Alice.<eos>
<bos>That's sweet.<eos>
<bos>Did you name her?<eos>
<bos>We named her all together.<eos>
<bos>I'm not allowed to talk outside.<eos>
<bos>That's all right.<eos>
<bos>I'm Dana Scully.<eos>
<bos>I don't mean you any harm.<eos>
<bos>Brother Andrew.<eos>
<bos>Scully, what are you doing?<eos>
<bos>I was just talking.<eos>
<bos>You all right?<eos>
<bos>Yeah. I think so.<eos>
<bos>You want to sit down?<eos>
<bos>Interesting way of life.<eos>
<bos>You get any sense about 'em?<eos>
<bos>There's something up there, Mulder.<eos>
<bos>Ooh, I've been saying that for years.<eos>
<bos>Oh, for a four-wheel drive.<eos>
<bos>Looks like about a mile walk.<eos>
<bos>After you.<eos>
<bos>Now...<eos>
<bos>this... that's west.<eos>
<bos>What does the map say?<eos>
<bos>That we should be there already.<eos>
<bos>Mulder, look.<eos>
<bos>Hmm?<eos>
<bos>We're FBI agents, federal police.<eos>
<bos>I'm Agent Mulder, this is Agent Scully.<eos>
<bos>We're here to investigate a murder.<eos>
<bos>I'm going to have to ask you<eos>
<bos>to remain at a distance.<eos>
<bos>Please, sir.<eos>
<bos>Your weapons<eos>
<bos>are forbidden here.<eos>
<bos>We can outlast you at this spot.<eos>
<bos>You're not leaving where we<eol>stand until your guns are handed<eos>
<bos>to our council.<eos>
<bos>You will have them again<eos>
<bos>as you leave.<eos>
<bos>We can't do that.<eos>
<bos>Please.<eos>
<bos>I'm Sister Abby.<eos>
<bos>This is Brother Oakley.<eos>
<bos>We are all saddened by<eol>what has happened in your world,<eos>
<bos>but it does not concern us.<eos>
<bos>Up here, no one kills another, ever.<eos>
<bos>We just want to have<eol>a few questions answered.<eos>
<bos>It is your weapons that are<eol>unwelcome here, not you.<eos>
<bos>Come and pray with us, be one of us,<eos>
<bos>and you'll see that we harm no one.<eos>
<bos>Please relinquish your weapons.<eos>
<bos>Please.<eos>
<bos>Now there is no reason to be afraid.<eos>
<bos>Come... sit.<eos>
<bos>Let us pray as one.<eos>
<bos>We who are separate give thanks<eos>
<bos>for our allotted time on this world.<eos>
<bos>We ask for strength<eos>
<bos>that we may bring forth<eol>the bounty that God<eos>
<bos>has provided.<eos>
<bos>Amen.<eos>
<bos>We pray for the day of the coming,<eos>
<bos>the moment of our release.<eos>
<bos>Amen.<eos>
<bos>Let us eat.<eos>
<bos>I was wondering if we might<eol>ask a few questions.<eos>
<bos>We're looking for someone<eos>
<bos>we believe may have come from here.<eos>
<bos>We have pictures.<eos>
<bos>We do not allow pictures.<eos>
<bos>A crime has been committed.<eos>
<bos>We have certain questions<eol>that we need answered<eos>
<bos>if you'll forgive us.<eos>
<bos>What are these pictures?<eos>
<bos>Hotel security videos<eol>of a man and a woman<eos>
<bos>who may have committed a murder.<eos>
<bos>Where was this crime committed?<eos>
<bos>In a hotel in Washington, D.C.<eos>
<bos>If we can arrange for you<eol>to look at the videotape,<eos>
<bos>maybe you can identify the individual.<eos>
<bos>How much violence has this person caused<eos>
<bos>in your world?<eos>
<bos>Five murders so far.<eos>
<bos>And may kill again,<eol>which is why we need your help.<eos>
<bos>Has anyone left recently?<eos>
<bos>Your world does not interest us.<eos>
<bos>We have no need<eos>
<bos>for your violence or your questions.<eos>
<bos>I've said what is needed.<eos>
<bos>They have no right to be here<eol>at this time.<eos>
<bos>Brother Wilton, stand.<eos>
<bos>Before we can accept any man's person,<eos>
<bos>we must accept our own.<eos>
<bos>And I ask who can stand in your sight<eos>
<bos>when once you are angry?<eos>
<bos>I am ashamed to lift up my face<eos>
<bos>and I shall not be ashamed<eol>in this evil time.<eos>
<bos>Make atonements for this wrath,<eol>Brother Wilton.<eos>
<bos>That's all right.<eos>
<bos>We didn't take any offense.<eos>
<bos>Anger, as violence, is not tolerated.<eos>
<bos>Our brother must be admonished.<eos>
<bos>He can't breathe.<eos>
<bos>He does not need your help.<eos>
<bos>He's choking to death.<eos>
<bos>Remove Brother Aaron<eos>
<bos>from the dining hall.<eos>
<bos>We did not invite you here to interfere.<eos>
<bos>We take care of our own.<eos>
<bos>Would you like to dance?<eos>
<bos>Not right now.<eos>
<bos>Look, I'm really not interested, okay?<eos>
<bos>Just one dance.<eos>
<bos>Yeah.<eos>
<bos>One dance.<eos>
<bos>It's a mile to your car.<eos>
<bos>Stay on the path.<eos>
<bos>Thanks for your cooperation.<eos>
<bos>The Addams Family finds religion.<eos>
<bos>Take me back to the 20th century.<eos>
<bos>You believe all that back there, Scully?<eos>
<bos>Believe all what?<eos>
<bos>All that "we take care<eol>of our own" business?<eos>
<bos>Well, they'd better<eol>take care of their own,<eos>
<bos>or that man at the dinner<eol>table is a dead man.<eos>
<bos>I think it was all an elaborate act.<eos>
<bos>What, the choking?<eos>
<bos>No, all this simple life<eol>"living from abundance" crap.<eos>
<bos>These people know something, Scully.<eos>
<bos>You can see it in their eyes--<eos>
<bos>the way they look at one another.<eos>
<bos>Do you think they know<eol>who the murderer is?<eos>
<bos>Did you notice how they managed<eos>
<bos>not to answer a single question of ours?<eos>
<bos>And that outburst<eol>at the table was right on cue.<eos>
<bos>Somehow they got us<eol>to answer their questions.<eos>
<bos>Did you ask yourself why there<eol>weren't any children around?<eos>
<bos>I know, that was odd.<eos>
<bos>You want to know what's really odd?<eos>
<bos>You know those pictures we saw<eos>
<bos>down in the store in Steveston today,<eos>
<bos>the ones from the '30s?<eos>
<bos>I swear I saw some of those same faces<eos>
<bos>at the dinner table tonight.<eos>
<bos>These people have probably<eol>been intermarrying for years.<eos>
<bos>Maybe.<eos>
<bos>Maybe not everything<eos>
<bos>is as black and white<eol>as it appears to be.<eos>
<bos>What are you doing?<eos>
<bos>I'm gonna go back for a little look-see.<eos>
<bos>Maybe they went to the movies.<eos>
<bos>You hear that?<eos>
<bos>What do you think?<eos>
<bos>I think I want to see<eol>what's in that cellar.<eos>
<bos>Come with me.<eos>
<bos>I can give you information.<eos>
<bos>I know who did it.<eos>
<bos>The murders?<eos>
<bos>You've heard our prayers.<eos>
<bos>You've seen how we live our beliefs.<eos>
<bos>I want you to find this killer.<eos>
<bos>I want you to find him for me.<eos>
<bos>He was my best friend.<eos>
<bos>What's his name?<eos>
<bos>Brother Martin.<eos>
<bos>I called him Marty.<eos>
<bos>Marty was different.<eos>
<bos>What do you mean, different?<eos>
<bos>How does he kill?<eos>
<bos>We're not sure.<eos>
<bos>All of the victims died<eol>of cardiac arrest.<eos>
<bos>He poisons them, doesn't he?<eos>
<bos>Maybe. How do you know that?<eos>
<bos>I need to show you something.<eos>
<bos>Something about Marty.<eos>
<bos>We found them out on Route 44.<eos>
<bos>We were wandering.<eos>
<bos>Marty and I used to do that.<eos>
<bos>Explore the edges of our world.<eos>
<bos>Somebody must have left them for garbage.<eos>
<bos>They are garbage.<eos>
<bos>Why did you keep them?<eos>
<bos>It was Martin who kept them.<eos>
<bos>Some of what I saw in the magazines--<eos>
<bos>some of it was beautiful,<eos>
<bos>but most of it I didn't like.<eos>
<bos>It was garish, but Martin... Marty,<eos>
<bos>he couldn't get enough.<eos>
<bos>He liked even the paper<eol>it was printed on-- slick.<eos>
<bos>Marty was captured by your world.<eos>
<bos>He left us to become one of you.<eos>
<bos>Brother Wilton.<eos>
<bos>The woman has returned.<eos>
<bos>Where is she?<eos>
<bos>With Andrew in the main house.<eos>
<bos>What about the other one?<eos>
<bos>He's missing.<eos>
<bos>You said Marty was different.<eos>
<bos>Yes.<eos>
<bos>How?<eos>
<bos>How did he kill his victims?<eos>
<bos>I could be banished.<eos>
<bos>Does it have something to do<eos>
<bos>with the ceremony in the barn tonight?<eos>
<bos>What are you doing?<eos>
<bos>Scully.<eos>
<bos>Marty is different.<eos>
<bos>We're all different.<eos>
<bos>Oh.<eos>
<bos>No.<eos>
<bos>Scully.<eos>
<bos>Get off of her.<eos>
<bos>I asked you not to interfere.<eos>
<bos>What the hell were you doing back there?<eos>
<bos>I don't know.<eos>
<bos>You don't know? No.<eos>
<bos>Are you all right?<eos>
<bos>I wasn't ignoring you.<eos>
<bos>No. Of course I saw you.<eos>
<bos>I just...<eos>
<bos>I didn't recognize you.<eos>
<bos>That's all.<eos>
<bos>Excuse me.<eos>
<bos>I'm on a conversation.<eos>
<bos>Sorry. No.<eos>
<bos>Thanks.<eos>
<bos>How you feeling?<eos>
<bos>Better.<eos>
<bos>A little embarrassed, actually.<eos>
<bos>Why? You don't remember any of it.<eos>
<bos>It's like I don't remember...<eos>
<bos>Why didn't you get out of there<eol>before he...?<eos>
<bos>Because he told me<eol>he knew who the killer was.<eos>
<bos>How did you know he wasn't the killer?<eos>
<bos>I believed him.<eos>
<bos>So, what did you see down in the cellar?<eos>
<bos>Just Brother What's-His-Name<eos>
<bos>buried in some gopher hole in the wall--<eos>
<bos>buried alive.<eos>
<bos>How do you know he was alive?<eos>
<bos>Because I was in there with him,<eol>and his face was, was different.<eos>
<bos>Even his hair-- it was almost feminine.<eos>
<bos>It was like he was going through<eol>some kind of a transformation.<eos>
<bos>Changing sexes?<eos>
<bos>That would explain<eol>the hotel security video.<eos>
<bos>So you're saying these people...<eos>
<bos>I know what I saw, Scully, and I saw you<eos>
<bos>about to do the wild thing<eol>with some stranger.<eos>
<bos>Think he was trying to kill me?<eos>
<bos>Maybe it's the sex that kills.<eos>
<bos>Well, if he was trying to kill<eol>me, why did they let us go?<eos>
<bos>I don't know.<eos>
<bos>All right, let's break it up.<eos>
<bos>Out of the car.<eos>
<bos>Sorry, Officer.<eos>
<bos>You, too.<eos>
<bos>You a pro?<eos>
<bos>Pro?<eos>
<bos>What?<eos>
<bos>On a scale of one to ten,<eol>she was a kind three.<eos>
<bos>But there was something about her.<eos>
<bos>Did she touch you or make<eos>
<bos>physical contact in any other manner?<eos>
<bos>Her touch was... electric.<eos>
<bos>But after that I remember...<eol>only vaguely.<eos>
<bos>What do you remember?<eos>
<bos>Nothing, actually.<eos>
<bos>Try to remember, Michel.<eos>
<bos>The policeman at the scene<eol>supports what you said.<eos>
<bos>But maybe there was something<eol>unusual about this woman...<eos>
<bos>something you wouldn't feel comfortable<eos>
<bos>telling the police on the record.<eos>
<bos>But this is off the record?<eos>
<bos>Absolutely. What did you see, Michel?<eos>
<bos>After she left the car, when<eol>she was fighting with the cop,<eos>
<bos>I saw her in her clothes<eol>and she looked like a...<eos>
<bos>She looked like a man.<eos>
<bos>She was a man.<eos>
<bos>Hustling in the club scene<eol>used to be so simple.<eos>
<bos>It's off the record?<eos>
<bos>Scout's honor.<eos>
<bos>We can't rule out the possibility<eos>
<bos>that what we're looking for<eol>is a transvestite.<eos>
<bos>I think Don Juan in there<eol>knows the difference<eos>
<bos>between the male and the<eol>female of the species.<eos>
<bos>I just don't want us<eol>to ignore the obvious.<eos>
<bos>I mean, how else could you explain<eos>
<bos>a woman overpowering a 200-pound cop?<eos>
<bos>She was a he.<eos>
<bos>Agent Mulder, Agent Scully,<eos>
<bos>the credit card that was stolen<eos>
<bos>from the last victim in D.C.<eos>
<bos>was just used to order<eol>takeout in a hotel downtown,<eos>
<bos>about eight blocks from here.<eos>
<bos>It was always forbidden.<eos>
<bos>But after the first time,<eol>I couldn't help myself.<eos>
<bos>Touching a human man or a woman...<eos>
<bos>is as powerful for me as it was for you.<eos>
<bos>This is Agent Scully<eol>requesting police backup<eos>
<bos>and additional agents<eos>
<bos>at 771 Catherine Street--<eol>it's the Hotel Catherine.<eos>
<bos>Your world offers pleasures...<eos>
<bos>pleasures we don't know<eol>because we're different.<eos>
<bos>But you know that now.<eos>
<bos>The others will punish me<eol>for what I've done.<eos>
<bos>They'll find me because<eol>the day is coming,<eos>
<bos>and they won't leave without me.<eos>
<bos>Mulder.<eos>
<bos>Delivery.<eos>
<bos>FBI!<eos>
<bos>FBI! Clear!<eos>
<bos>Stay down!<eos>
<bos>Got a body!<eos>
<bos>Scully?<eos>
<bos>I'm okay.<eos>
<bos>Scully, down the stairs.<eos>
<bos>Federal agent! I'm armed!<eos>
<bos>Back away!<eos>
<bos>Step away!<eos>
<bos>Step away.<eos>
<bos>Please...<eos>
<bos>don't hurt him.<eos>
<bos>No.<eos>
<bos>Step away.<eos>
<bos>I'm armed.<eos>
<bos>Scully!<eos>
<bos>The surrounding ten blocks<eos>
<bos>have been secured for the past hour.<eos>
<bos>We set up roadblocks<eos>
<bos>on all the routes out to Steveston.<eos>
<bos>So far nothing, no reports of them.<eos>
<bos>There's no way they could<eol>have gotten through.<eos>
<bos>What if they did get through?<eos>
<bos>There's only one place they'd hide.<eos>
<bos>They're gone.<eos>
<bos>We found something<eos>
<bos>in the hay field.<eos>
<bos>I don't understand.<eos>
<bos>How can they just disappear?<eos>
<bos>They have no means of transportation.<eos>
<bos>No earthly means of transportation.<eos>
