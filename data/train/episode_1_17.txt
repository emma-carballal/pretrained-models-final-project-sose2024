<bos>Yup. All year.<eos>
<bos>Since you always made us<eol>take the Christmas tree down<eos>
<bos>the day after Christmas,<eol>I'm making up for lost time.<eos>
<bos>If your idea of a good time is<eol>to pick up dried pine needles,<eos>
<bos>treat yourself.<eos>
<bos>As if he's an authority<eol>on having a good time.<eos>
<bos>That's okay, Mom. I got that.<eos>
<bos>Oh. Okay.<eos>
<bos>Okay, Maggie,<eos>
<bos>let's shove off.<eos>
<bos>Oh. Okay.<eos>
<bos>Well, thank you for having us.<eos>
<bos>Dinner was delicious, as usual.<eos>
<bos>Thanks, Mom.<eos>
<bos>Good sailing, Ahab.<eos>
<bos>Good night, Starbuck.<eos>
<bos>How is work? Good?<eos>
<bos>Yup.<eos>
<bos>It's good.<eos>
<bos>Well...<eos>
<bos>Well, drive carefully.<eos>
<bos>Uh-huh.<eos>
<bos>Good night, Daddy.<eos>
<bos>Here on Incredible Inventions, though,<eos>
<bos>you're not going to spend $110.00 for it.<eos>
<bos>You all know that.<eos>
<bos>You're not even going to spend $100.00.<eos>
<bos>There's an approximate<eol>one-month supply here<eos>
<bos>and all you'll spend<eol>for this entire package<eos>
<bos>is just $39.92.<eos>
<bos>I was kind of interested<eos>
<bos>that Allen was a blond...<eos>
<bos>Dad?<eos>
<bos>I thought you guys left.<eos>
<bos>Where's Mom?<eos>
<bos>Hello.<eos>
<bos>Hello?<eos>
<bos>Dana...<eos>
<bos>Mom?<eos>
<bos>What's the matter?<eos>
<bos>We, um...<eos>
<bos>we lost your dad.<eos>
<bos>He had a... a massive coronary<eol>about an hour ago.<eos>
<bos>He's gone.<eos>
<bos>I swear, Christmas Day...<eos>
<bos>my whole family's<eol>opening presents and all<eos>
<bos>and I'm just sitting there<eos>
<bos>in my own little world thinking<eos>
<bos>"I just wish Jim were here."<eos>
<bos>I know.<eos>
<bos>Oh, man... busted.<eos>
<bos>Yes, sir?<eos>
<bos>Out of the vehicle, please.<eos>
<bos>Sir, I'm sorry.<eos>
<bos>We'll be on our way.<eos>
<bos>I said, out of the vehicle.<eos>
<bos>Keep your hands down.<eos>
<bos>Let's see some I.D.<eos>
<bos>No. Not till I see yours.<eos>
<bos>Last time you were that engrossed,<eos>
<bos>it turned out you were reading<eol>the adult video news.<eos>
<bos>I didn't think you'd be in today.<eos>
<bos>How are you, Dana?<eos>
<bos>"Dana."<eos>
<bos>I'm fine.<eos>
<bos>Thank you.<eos>
<bos>What are you working on?<eos>
<bos>Two days ago, a couple was kidnapped<eos>
<bos>at Jackson University.<eos>
<bos>Elizabeth Hawley<eol>and James Summers-- both 19.<eos>
<bos>Last year, another couple<eol>was kidnapped to the day.<eos>
<bos>Except that abduction occurred<eol>at Duke University.<eos>
<bos>One week later, they found<eol>both students' bodies dead.<eos>
<bos>They were kept alive,<eol>tortured during that period.<eos>
<bos>No arrests were ever made.<eos>
<bos>Police believed it to be<eol>a one-time offender.<eos>
<bos>But now it appears to be<eol>a serial incident.<eos>
<bos>Anyway... if he holds true to form,<eos>
<bos>we have five days to find those kids.<eos>
<bos>That's a grim deadline.<eos>
<bos>Here's another grim deadline.<eos>
<bos>In one week, Luther Lee Boggs<eol>will take a seat<eos>
<bos>in the North Carolina gas chamber.<eos>
<bos>How is he related?<eos>
<bos>He claims to have information<eol>relating to the kidnapping.<eos>
<bos>He described Hawley's bracelet<eos>
<bos>down to the last detail.<eos>
<bos>This is information that<eol>only family members<eos>
<bos>could have known.<eos>
<bos>Or the kidnapper.<eos>
<bos>Boggs feels that if his talents<eol>help save these kids,<eos>
<bos>then his sentence should<eol>be reduced to life in prison.<eos>
<bos>His "talents"?<eos>
<bos>He claims to have<eol>obtained this information<eos>
<bos>through psychic transmissions.<eos>
<bos>Mulder, do I detect a hint of skepticism?<eos>
<bos>Perhaps.<eos>
<bos>Boggs has been there before...<eos>
<bos>in the chamber.<eos>
<bos>My profile helped send him there.<eos>
<bos>He was actually<eos>
<bos>strapped to the chair<eos>
<bos>before receiving an executive stay.<eos>
<bos>He claims that this experience<eos>
<bos>activated in him the ability<eol>to channel spirits and demons.<eos>
<bos>I believe in psychic ability<eos>
<bos>without a doubt,<eos>
<bos>but not in this case.<eos>
<bos>Not Boggs.<eos>
<bos>So you believe that Boggs<eos>
<bos>is orchestrating the kidnapping<eol>from the inside.<eos>
<bos>A scam to save his life?<eos>
<bos>At the age of six, Luther Boggs<eos>
<bos>slaughtered every pet animal<eol>in his housing project.<eos>
<bos>When he was 30,<eos>
<bos>he strangled five family members<eol>over Thanksgiving dinner<eos>
<bos>and then sat down<eol>to watch the fourth quarter<eos>
<bos>of the Detroit-Green Bay game.<eos>
<bos>Some killers are products of society.<eos>
<bos>Some act out past abuses.<eos>
<bos>Boggs kills because he likes it.<eos>
<bos>And they've requested you speak with him?<eos>
<bos>Actually, he's requested to speak to me.<eos>
<bos>Why you?<eos>
<bos>He read my profile on him<eos>
<bos>and he feels like I'm the only one<eos>
<bos>who truly understands what he is.<eos>
<bos>Anyway, I leave for Raleigh<eol>this afternoon.<eos>
<bos>I'll go with you.<eos>
<bos>The funeral is at noon.<eos>
<bos>I think you should take some time.<eos>
<bos>I need to work.<eos>
<bos>I'm sorry about your father.<eos>
<bos>I'll see you later.<eos>
<bos>Okay.<eos>
<bos>As a captain,<eos>
<bos>he was entitled to burial in Arlington<eos>
<bos>with full ceremony.<eos>
<bos>This is exactly the way he wanted it.<eos>
<bos>Just the family.<eos>
<bos>This song was playing<eos>
<bos>when his ship returned<eol>from the Cuban Blockade.<eos>
<bos>He marched right off, up to me...<eos>
<bos>and he proposed.<eos>
<bos>I know that you and Dad<eol>were... disappointed<eos>
<bos>that I chose the path I'm on,<eos>
<bos>instead of medicine<eos>
<bos>but I need to know--<eos>
<bos>Was he at all proud of me?<eos>
<bos>He was your father.<eos>
<bos>The soul of Luther Boggs<eos>
<bos>drowns in Hell's sea of fire.<eos>
<bos>We have him now.<eos>
<bos>We?<eos>
<bos>You mean the souls of your victims?<eos>
<bos>The dead.<eos>
<bos>The living.<eos>
<bos>All souls are connected.<eos>
<bos>And you're the conduit?<eos>
<bos>Uh, Dana...<eos>
<bos>Fox...<eos>
<bos>please understand that from here<eos>
<bos>we can return to the past.<eos>
<bos>We can see the present.<eos>
<bos>We can know the future.<eos>
<bos>From here?<eos>
<bos>Where exactly are you?<eos>
<bos>Mr. Boggs must be made redemptive<eos>
<bos>for his transgressions.<eos>
<bos>That's exactly what the state<eol>of North Carolina<eos>
<bos>intends to do next week.<eos>
<bos>Uh-uh.<eos>
<bos>Let's deal.<eos>
<bos>Boggs' life for the kids.<eos>
<bos>You know what I'm saying?<eos>
<bos>First you've got to prove<eol>you're telling the truth.<eos>
<bos>Don't get me wrong, Luther.<eos>
<bos>I want to believe.<eos>
<bos>God!<eos>
<bos>No.<eos>
<bos>Must stop.<eos>
<bos>Pain!<eos>
<bos>Pain. Terrible pain.<eos>
<bos>Um, the boy.<eos>
<bos>Uh, Jim.<eos>
<bos>Uh, he's tied with twine.<eos>
<bos>Uh, packing twine.<eos>
<bos>He whips them with a coat hanger,<eos>
<bos>a wire coat hanger.<eos>
<bos>Oh.<eos>
<bos>Dark place.<eos>
<bos>Cold.<eos>
<bos>A cellar.<eos>
<bos>Warehouse, condemned.<eos>
<bos>An angel of stone.<eos>
<bos>Waterfall.<eos>
<bos>Water falling.<eos>
<bos>That's not a waterfall.<eos>
<bos>Not water.<eos>
<bos>They're there.<eos>
<bos>Oh, God.<eos>
<bos>I got to go.<eos>
<bos>I got to go.<eos>
<bos>I... got to go.<eos>
<bos>I tore this off my<eol>New York Knicks t-shirt.<eos>
<bos>It has nothing to do with the crime.<eos>
<bos>Somewhere...<eos>
<bos>Beyond the sea...<eos>
<bos>Somewhere...<eos>
<bos>Waiting for me...<eos>
<bos>Did you get my message, Starbuck?<eos>
<bos>Thanks a lot.<eos>
<bos>Scully, what's wrong?<eos>
<bos>Did Boggs say something to you?<eos>
<bos>No.<eos>
<bos>It's my father.<eos>
<bos>I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<eos>
<bos>That's all right.<eos>
<bos>Why don't you go back to the motel.<eos>
<bos>We've exposed Boggs as a fraud.<eos>
<bos>Boggs is not what he claims to be.<eos>
<bos>He may be orchestrating the kidnapping.<eos>
<bos>Now he knows we're on to him,<eos>
<bos>he doesn't have a chance<eol>with this charade.<eos>
<bos>I'm going to wait around<eol>here for a couple hours<eos>
<bos>and try to interrogate him.<eos>
<bos>Hopefully, he'll tell me<eol>where the kids are.<eos>
<bos>Somewhere beyond the shore...<eos>
<bos>We'll kiss just as before...<eos>
<bos>Happy we'll be...<eos>
<bos>Beyond the sea...<eos>
<bos>And never again.<eos>
<bos>Water falling.<eos>
<bos>It's not a waterfall.<eos>
<bos>An angel of stone.<eos>
<bos>It's Mulder.<eos>
<bos>I just heard that Liz Hawley's family<eos>
<bos>made a positive I.D.<eos>
<bos>on the charm you found at the warehouse.<eos>
<bos>The police are searching<eol>that place inch by inch<eos>
<bos>but they haven't been able<eol>to find anything yet.<eos>
<bos>I expected to find you<eol>at the crime scene.<eos>
<bos>Did Boggs confess?<eos>
<bos>No. No. It was five hours<eol>of Boggs's channeling.<eos>
<bos>After three hours,<eos>
<bos>I asked him to summon up<eol>the soul of Jimi Hendrix<eos>
<bos>and requested "All Along the Watchtower."<eos>
<bos>You know, the guy's been dead 20 years<eos>
<bos>but he still hasn't lost his edge.<eos>
<bos>I lied to the police<eol>about how I found the warehouse.<eos>
<bos>I didn't notice any suspicious activity.<eos>
<bos>Then how did you find it?<eos>
<bos>It was where Boggs said it would be.<eos>
<bos>Scully, I told you about Boggs.<eos>
<bos>I didn't go looking for it!<eos>
<bos>I came across an area that<eol>had landmarks he spoke of.<eos>
<bos>That doesn't matter!<eos>
<bos>That's exactly what Boggs wanted.<eos>
<bos>He could have been setting you up.<eos>
<bos>You could be dead right now.<eos>
<bos>Why did you feel you had to lie<eol>on your police report?<eos>
<bos>I thought it would be<eol>a better explanation<eos>
<bos>under the circumstances.<eos>
<bos>What you're really saying is<eos>
<bos>that you didn't want to go on record<eos>
<bos>admitting that you believed in Boggs.<eos>
<bos>The Bureau would expect<eol>something like that<eos>
<bos>from Spooky Mulder,<eos>
<bos>but not Dana Scully.<eos>
<bos>I thought that you would be pleased<eos>
<bos>that I'd opened myself<eol>to extreme possibilities.<eos>
<bos>Why now?<eos>
<bos>After all we've seen, why Boggs?<eos>
<bos>Does this have to do with your father?<eos>
<bos>He said that he didn't approve<eos>
<bos>of you becoming an FBI agent.<eos>
<bos>If being on the job now<eol>makes you feel guilty<eos>
<bos>or uncomfortable or uneasy,<eos>
<bos>I think you should back away.<eos>
<bos>Because if it's clouding your judgment,<eos>
<bos>you're putting yourself in danger.<eos>
<bos>I love this job.<eos>
<bos>You love your father.<eos>
<bos>Dana...<eos>
<bos>open yourself up to extreme possibilities<eos>
<bos>only when they're the truth.<eos>
<bos>That goes for Luther Boggs...<eos>
<bos>and your father.<eos>
<bos>As for Luther Boggs,<eos>
<bos>he's the greatest of lies.<eos>
<bos>I know he's working<eol>with someone on the outside<eos>
<bos>and they planted that evidence,<eos>
<bos>and we have to be very careful<eol>about plotting our next move<eos>
<bos>because he's planned five steps ahead.<eos>
<bos>The only advantage we have is time.<eos>
<bos>Scully, take a look at this.<eos>
<bos>That's incredible.<eos>
<bos>They found them?<eos>
<bos>That's exactly what<eol>I want Boggs to think.<eos>
<bos>I don't understand.<eos>
<bos>Why didn't the police notify us?<eos>
<bos>They haven't been found.<eol>The article is bogus.<eos>
<bos>The Carolinian made this<eol>one up just for us.<eos>
<bos>Only six people know about it.<eos>
<bos>Later on today, Boggs gets<eol>his weekly phone privileges.<eos>
<bos>Hopefully, he'll call his accomplice<eos>
<bos>to find out what happened.<eos>
<bos>Phone privilege is in two hours.<eos>
<bos>Go.<eos>
<bos>Turn off that phone.<eos>
<bos>Turn it off.<eos>
<bos>Mulder, it's you.<eos>
<bos>Mulder.<eos>
<bos>How come you don't believe me?<eos>
<bos>Agent Scully does.<eos>
<bos>She believes me.<eos>
<bos>Agent Scully believes<eol>what we all believe--<eos>
<bos>that you have the kids.<eos>
<bos>Now, where are they?<eos>
<bos>Mulder, even if he is setting us up<eos>
<bos>we have to follow,<eol>because in three days...<eos>
<bos>Liz Hawley and Jim Summers will be dead.<eos>
<bos>And then, a day later,<eol>our only connection to the case<eos>
<bos>will be pulling up a chair<eol>at the gas chamber.<eos>
<bos>We have to deal.<eos>
<bos>The kidnapper is aroused<eos>
<bos>by the prospect of becoming a killer.<eos>
<bos>What's the name?<eos>
<bos>Can't see...<eos>
<bos>male...<eos>
<bos>Describe him.<eos>
<bos>Small...<eos>
<bos>thin...<eos>
<bos>late 20s...<eos>
<bos>skull...<eos>
<bos>human skull...<eos>
<bos>silver gray...<eos>
<bos>his eyes...<eos>
<bos>cold... very cold...<eos>
<bos>staring at Elizabeth...<eos>
<bos>God, he's got the wire...<eos>
<bos>No...<eos>
<bos>please... no.<eos>
<bos>Where is he?<eos>
<bos>He's over...<eos>
<bos>over...<eos>
<bos>by the window...<eos>
<bos>holding back his...<eos>
<bos>holding back his thoughts<eol>of killing us...<eos>
<bos>waiting...<eos>
<bos>there's a small boathouse on Lake Jordan.<eos>
<bos>You got that?<eos>
<bos>Mulder...<eos>
<bos>don't go near the white cross.<eos>
<bos>We see you down...<eos>
<bos>and your blood spills on the white cross.<eos>
<bos>No, no, no...!<eos>
<bos>Anything?<eos>
<bos>Sweep the docks!<eos>
<bos>Got it!<eos>
<bos>Federal agent!<eos>
<bos>Mulder!<eos>
<bos>We need an ambulance!<eos>
<bos>Officer down!<eos>
<bos>Coming through! What do we got?<eos>
<bos>It's a through-and-through, upper femur.<eos>
<bos>Can't palpate a radial pulse.<eos>
<bos>Okay, I want a BP on him, stat.<eos>
<bos>Let's get him on the gurney.<eos>
<bos>Blood pressure is 67 on palpation.<eos>
<bos>Okay, tighten and screen him for six.<eos>
<bos>I want two liters of normal saline in now<eos>
<bos>and give him two units<eol>of O-neg after the typing.<eos>
<bos>Let's transfer now.<eos>
<bos>No.<eos>
<bos>Lucas Jackson Henry, 28.<eos>
<bos>Did some time at Angola in Louisiana<eos>
<bos>for sexual assault, narcotics...<eos>
<bos>nothing big, really.<eos>
<bos>His personal history<eol>includes being witness<eos>
<bos>to an auto accident<eos>
<bos>in which his high school<eol>sweetheart was killed<eos>
<bos>and his mother decapitated.<eos>
<bos>The seven-year anniversary<eos>
<bos>of that accident is in three days.<eos>
<bos>He's reliving it.<eos>
<bos>That would explain the deadline.<eos>
<bos>The most important element we found<eos>
<bos>is there's substantial suspicion<eos>
<bos>that Luther Lee Boggs' last five murders<eos>
<bos>were committed with a partner.<eos>
<bos>Now, the police up in Durham say<eos>
<bos>they could never prove it in court<eos>
<bos>but they know that partner<eol>was Lucas Henry.<eos>
<bos>You set us up.<eos>
<bos>You're in on this with Lucas Henry.<eos>
<bos>This was a trap for Mulder<eos>
<bos>because he helped put you away.<eos>
<bos>Well, I came here to tell you<eos>
<bos>that if he dies<eol>because of what you've done,<eos>
<bos>four days from now,<eos>
<bos>nobody will stop me from being the one<eos>
<bos>that will throw the switch<eol>and gas you out of this life<eos>
<bos>for good, you son of a bitch!<eos>
<bos>Dana...<eos>
<bos>you're the one that believed me.<eos>
<bos>No...<eos>
<bos>no, I do not believe you!<eos>
<bos>If you don't believe me,<eos>
<bos>maybe you'll believe yourself.<eos>
<bos>There was that one time, when I was 14,<eos>
<bos>and my parents had gone to bed<eos>
<bos>and I snuck downstairs all alone.<eos>
<bos>Got one of my mom's cigarettes<eos>
<bos>and went out onto the porch in the dark.<eos>
<bos>I was so scared.<eos>
<bos>My heart was beating.<eos>
<bos>I mean, they would've<eol>killed me if they knew.<eos>
<bos>But I was so excited.<eos>
<bos>Not 'cause of the cigarette--<eol>I mean, it was gross, but...<eos>
<bos>because I wasn't supposed to.<eos>
<bos>That could be a moment<eol>from any kid's life.<eos>
<bos>I know what you want<eos>
<bos>and I know who you want to talk to.<eos>
<bos>Why don't you just go ahead and ask me.<eos>
<bos>I'll believe you...<eos>
<bos>if you let m...<eos>
<bos>me talk to him.<eos>
<bos>Starbuck...<eos>
<bos>No, no, no!<eos>
<bos>Nobody talks to anybody<eol>until I get a deal.<eos>
<bos>Don't underestimate my fear of dying<eos>
<bos>and don't downplay my terror<eol>of going back to that chair.<eos>
<bos>I know my hell's going to be<eos>
<bos>to go on back to that chair<eol>over and over again<eos>
<bos>for all of time,<eos>
<bos>but in this life-- my one and only life--<eos>
<bos>I don't ever want to go back again.<eos>
<bos>Ever!<eos>
<bos>The last time I went to death's door<eos>
<bos>and looked inside<eos>
<bos>I had never talked to a minister before<eos>
<bos>in my life, ever, until that day<eos>
<bos>and he said, "He who doth not love<eos>
<bos>"remains in death.<eos>
<bos>"And he who hates his brother<eol>is a murderer<eos>
<bos>"and no murderer has eternal life<eos>
<bos>abiding in him."<eos>
<bos>My family, who I killed<eol>after their last meal<eos>
<bos>was right there to watch me over mine<eos>
<bos>and their fear<eos>
<bos>and their horror<eos>
<bos>that I made them feel when I killed them<eos>
<bos>was injected into me<eos>
<bos>and their collective fear alone<eos>
<bos>was just one taste of Hell.<eos>
<bos>And then I felt myself leave my body.<eos>
<bos>I thought they had already killed me<eos>
<bos>and I saw thousands<eos>
<bos>of souls rushing into my body.<eos>
<bos>It is a cold, dark place, Scully.<eos>
<bos>Mulder's looking in on it right now.<eos>
<bos>It may be a cold, dark place for you<eos>
<bos>but it's not for Mulder<eol>and it's not for my father.<eos>
<bos>I'm sure he'd like to tell you hisself<eos>
<bos>but I'm not going to let him.<eos>
<bos>Nobody speaks until you get me a deal.<eos>
<bos>I don't believe you.<eos>
<bos>Oh, well, there's plenty of room<eos>
<bos>in that cold, dark place<eol>for liars, Scully.<eos>
<bos>You go ahead and play it like you need to<eos>
<bos>but I know you believe me.<eos>
<bos>But if you need to convince<eol>a judge I'm in on it with Lucas,<eos>
<bos>go ahead, 'cause either way--<eos>
<bos>whether I'm running the show<eol>with Lucas or I'm channeling--<eos>
<bos>no information's coming<eol>till I get a deal.<eos>
<bos>I got nothing to lose.<eos>
<bos>Guard!<eos>
<bos>If I die...<eos>
<bos>that boy goes to that cold, dark place.<eos>
<bos>The governor and the supreme court<eos>
<bos>of North Carolina do not intend<eos>
<bos>to make a deal with a mass murderer.<eos>
<bos>Especially one who I know<eol>is orchestrating<eos>
<bos>a capital offense<eos>
<bos>two days before his capital punishment.<eos>
<bos>Yes, sir.<eos>
<bos>The only thing Boggs will get from me<eos>
<bos>is a timely death.<eos>
<bos>It's an overdue one at that.<eos>
<bos>We're running out of time.<eos>
<bos>There's still no sign of Lucas Henry<eos>
<bos>or Jim Summers.<eos>
<bos>The Raleigh police said...<eos>
<bos>No matter what, don't believe him.<eos>
<bos>Boggs created this whole charade<eol>to get back at me<eos>
<bos>for putting him on Death Row.<eos>
<bos>You'd be the next best thing.<eos>
<bos>Mulder, I never thought I'd say this...<eos>
<bos>...but what if there's<eol>another explanation?<eos>
<bos>Don't... deal with him.<eos>
<bos>He could be trying to claim you<eos>
<bos>as his last victim.<eos>
<bos>All right, Mr. Boggs...<eos>
<bos>you got your deal.<eos>
<bos>Thank you, ma'am.<eos>
<bos>Thank you.<eos>
<bos>All right, where are they?<eos>
<bos>Uh... I...<eos>
<bos>I see, like, uh...<eos>
<bos>uh, circles.<eos>
<bos>I don't know, like... barrels.<eos>
<bos>No.<eos>
<bos>No, bigger.<eos>
<bos>Like, uh...<eos>
<bos>huge, uh...<eos>
<bos>vats, uh...<eos>
<bos>factory.<eos>
<bos>Uh, condemned.<eos>
<bos>The old, uh, Blue Devil Brewery<eos>
<bos>up by Morrisville.<eos>
<bos>Oh, God, he's getting, uh...<eos>
<bos>he's getting ready.<eos>
<bos>He...<eos>
<bos>he's getting ready to, um...<eos>
<bos>he's getting ready to kill the d...<eos>
<bos>Luther, if you really were psychic...<eos>
<bos>I would've known you lied.<eos>
<bos>That there never was a deal.<eos>
<bos>I know you tried.<eos>
<bos>Scully...<eos>
<bos>Avoid the Devil.<eos>
<bos>Don't follow Henry to the Devil.<eos>
<bos>Leave that to me.<eos>
<bos>Freeze!<eos>
<bos>Federal agents! We're armed!<eos>
<bos>Drop your weapon.<eos>
<bos>There he is.<eos>
<bos>Hold on... All right.<eos>
<bos>...get over here!<eos>
<bos>Go!<eos>
<bos>Oh, my God...<eos>
<bos>Easy, easy...<eos>
<bos>Over here!<eos>
<bos>He fell down.<eos>
<bos>You come to say good-bye?<eos>
<bos>I believe...<eos>
<bos>...that if you had orchestrated<eol>this kidnapping,<eos>
<bos>Lucas Henry would have<eos>
<bos>been aware of the danger<eol>you warned me about.<eos>
<bos>He never would have crossed that bridge.<eos>
<bos>So you saved...<eos>
<bos>Jim Summers' life.<eos>
<bos>But you saved mine as well.<eos>
<bos>You come for some unfinished business.<eos>
<bos>You want your father's message.<eos>
<bos>Not now.<eos>
<bos>Be there tonight.<eos>
<bos>My witness.<eos>
<bos>And when they got me<eol>in that chair and they...<eos>
<bos>open up that shield...<eos>
<bos>...you get your message.<eos>
<bos>Our Father Who art in Heaven,<eos>
<bos>hallowed be Thy name.<eos>
<bos>Thy kingdom come,<eos>
<bos>Thy will be done on earth<eol>as it is in Heaven...<eos>
<bos>Would you like to make a statement?<eos>
<bos>...our daily bread,<eos>
<bos>and forgive us our trespasses<eos>
<bos>as we forgive those<eol>that trespass against us.<eos>
<bos>And lead us not into temptation<eol>but deliver us from evil,<eos>
<bos>for Thine is the kingdom,<eol>and the power and the glory<eos>
<bos>forever and ever, Amen.<eos>
<bos>I was considering Boggs.<eos>
<bos>If he knew that I was your partner,<eos>
<bos>he could have found out<eol>everything he knew about me.<eos>
<bos>About my father.<eos>
<bos>Scully...<eos>
<bos>"Beyond the Sea" was playing<eol>at my parents' wedding.<eos>
<bos>Visions of deceased loved ones<eos>
<bos>are a common psychological phenomena.<eos>
<bos>If he knew that my father had--<eos>
<bos>Dana...<eos>
<bos>after all you've seen,<eos>
<bos>after all the evidence,<eos>
<bos>why can't you believe?<eos>
<bos>I'm afraid.<eos>
<bos>I'm afraid to believe.<eos>
<bos>You couldn't face that fear?<eos>
<bos>Even if it meant never knowing<eos>
<bos>what your father wanted to tell you?<eos>
<bos>But I do know.<eos>
<bos>How?<eos>
<bos>He was my father.<eos>
