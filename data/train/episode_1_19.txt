<bos>Mom! Mom!<eos>
<bos>Mom! Kevin.<eos>
<bos>Mom! Ruby's gone!<eos>
<bos>Ruby?<eos>
<bos>Agent Mulder's latest 302<eos>
<bos>requesting assignment and travel expenses<eos>
<bos>for the both of you.<eos>
<bos>Sioux City, Iowa.<eos>
<bos>That's the first I've heard of it.<eos>
<bos>It came up through channels<eos>
<bos>from Mulder's ASAC to the District G-14<eos>
<bos>and onto my desk.<eos>
<bos>I don't understand.<eos>
<bos>In essence, Mulder is<eol>petitioning the bureau<eos>
<bos>to assign a case number<eos>
<bos>to a tabloid headline.<eos>
<bos>He must have more evidence than...<eos>
<bos>Not according to his 302, he doesn't.<eos>
<bos>I admit, that is strange...<eos>
<bos>even for Mulder.<eos>
<bos>Perhaps it has something to do with this.<eos>
<bos>Take a look.<eos>
<bos>An X file?<eos>
<bos>Has he shared any of this with you?<eos>
<bos>There's no need to protect him.<eos>
<bos>He's the agent of record.<eos>
<bos>He initiated the file himself.<eos>
<bos>She was his sister.<eos>
<bos>She disappeared 21 years ago.<eos>
<bos>He was 12 and she was eight.<eos>
<bos>He claims that he was in<eol>the room when it happened.<eos>
<bos>He recalls a bright light<eol>outside the window<eos>
<bos>and, uh... and a presence in the room.<eos>
<bos>In your opinion,<eos>
<bos>has Agent Mulder's personal agenda<eos>
<bos>clouded his professional judgment?<eos>
<bos>In my opinion, no.<eos>
<bos>But you can see how<eol>it might appear that way.<eos>
<bos>As you know,<eos>
<bos>Agent Mulder's preoccupation<eol>with fringe matters<eos>
<bos>has been a big source<eol>of friction in the bureau.<eos>
<bos>This is another case in point.<eos>
<bos>I'm going to disallow the 302.<eos>
<bos>With respect, sir,<eos>
<bos>at least let me talk with him<eos>
<bos>and make a recommendation.<eos>
<bos>It just doesn't seem...<eos>
<bos>substantial enough<eol>to warrant an investigation.<eos>
<bos>Okay, Scully, so we disagree.<eos>
<bos>It's not the first time,<eol>and it won't be the last.<eos>
<bos>Well, at least if we had<eol>a legitimate source, we could...<eos>
<bos>This is the essence of science.<eos>
<bos>You ask an impertinent question<eos>
<bos>and you're on your way<eol>to a pertinent answer.<eos>
<bos>What makes this case any more credible<eos>
<bos>than the 100-year-old mother<eol>with the lizard baby?<eos>
<bos>Because the lizard baby<eos>
<bos>wasn't born anywhere near Lake Okobogee.<eos>
<bos>Oko-what?<eos>
<bos>Bogee.<eos>
<bos>Okobogee.<eos>
<bos>Is that supposed to mean something to me?<eos>
<bos>If you know anything about trout fishing<eos>
<bos>or UFO hot spots.<eos>
<bos>Define hot spot.<eos>
<bos>Four sightings<eos>
<bos>in 1967, August,<eos>
<bos>including one by a National<eol>Weather Service plane.<eos>
<bos>This is a light-blasted,<eol>digitally enhanced enlargement.<eos>
<bos>The pilot took that photograph?<eos>
<bos>Try a Girl Scout with an Instamatic.<eos>
<bos>Four of the nine girls in the troop<eos>
<bos>claim to have seen something--<eos>
<bos>five if you include the den mother.<eos>
<bos>The Air Force said it<eol>was a weather balloon<eos>
<bos>caught in a wind shear,<eos>
<bos>but there wasn't a weather balloon<eos>
<bos>launched that day within 700 miles.<eos>
<bos>Now, read me the names of<eol>those Girl Scouts from 1967.<eos>
<bos>Lisa Terrel, Bonnie Winston,<eos>
<bos>Doreen McCallister, Darlene Morr...<eos>
<bos>It's the same Darlene Morris.<eos>
<bos>Ms. Darlene Morris?<eos>
<bos>I'm Agent Scully,<eol>and this is Agent Fox Mulder.<eos>
<bos>We talked with you<eol>on the phone last night.<eos>
<bos>Please, come in.<eos>
<bos>Well, I knew that if I screamed<eol>loud and long enough<eos>
<bos>that someone would listen,<eos>
<bos>but I never expected the FBI.<eos>
<bos>Uh, this is Kevin.<eos>
<bos>Kevin, say hi.<eos>
<bos>Would you like some coffee?<eos>
<bos>Some days, I can't even...<eos>
<bos>get myself up out of bed<eos>
<bos>and... Kevin has been acting so strange.<eos>
<bos>I don't know what to do anymore.<eos>
<bos>I just want her back again.<eos>
<bos>Ms. Morris,<eos>
<bos>during the divorce,<eol>was there a custody battle?<eos>
<bos>Charles had nothing to do with this.<eos>
<bos>How can you be so sure?<eos>
<bos>Because I know what happened.<eos>
<bos>It's just like it was before.<eos>
<bos>Summer of 1967?<eos>
<bos>The Girl Scout troop?<eos>
<bos>How did you know about that?<eos>
<bos>Your name's on record<eos>
<bos>at the Center for UFO Studies<eol>in Evanston, Illinois.<eos>
<bos>Really?<eos>
<bos>Yeah, a pilot<eos>
<bos>for the National Weather Service<eos>
<bos>made a similar sighting over<eol>the same area on the same day.<eos>
<bos>They took her, didn't they, Mr. Mulder?<eos>
<bos>You said that, um, Kevin<eol>was there the night it happened?<eos>
<bos>He didn't see anything.<eos>
<bos>He was asleep.<eos>
<bos>Do you think I might talk to him anyway?<eos>
<bos>Mmm.<eos>
<bos>Thanks.<eos>
<bos>You know...<eos>
<bos>I've told the story so many times now...<eos>
<bos>oh, to the newspapers and the police...<eos>
<bos>and every time I tell it,<eos>
<bos>people get this look in their eye<eos>
<bos>just like the look<eos>
<bos>that you've got right now.<eos>
<bos>Hey, buddy.<eos>
<bos>You mind if I sit down?<eos>
<bos>Thanks.<eos>
<bos>Your mom tells me<eol>you've been having nightmares.<eos>
<bos>I guess so.<eos>
<bos>You want to tell me about them?<eos>
<bos>No.<eos>
<bos>All right.<eos>
<bos>What are you doing?<eos>
<bos>You making something?<eos>
<bos>Can I take a look at it?<eos>
<bos>Thanks.<eos>
<bos>It's coming from there.<eos>
<bos>The TV?<eos>
<bos>I don't know what it is: maybe<eol>a binary sequence of some kind.<eos>
<bos>Could be anything, could be nothing.<eos>
<bos>I know you're busy.<eos>
<bos>Look, um, I know a friend<eos>
<bos>who knows a friend who knows a friend<eos>
<bos>who can get you a ticket<eol>to a Redskins game.<eos>
<bos>You got it. All right.<eos>
<bos>You know where to find me?<eos>
<bos>Thanks, Danny.<eos>
<bos>So, as I was telling your partner,<eos>
<bos>we found no evidence of kidnap.<eos>
<bos>No phone call, no ransom note<eos>
<bos>and since we didn't turn up a body...<eos>
<bos>You assume she ran away.<eos>
<bos>Well, it wouldn't be<eos>
<bos>the first time Ruby Morris<eol>ran away from home.<eos>
<bos>How do you explain what her mother saw?<eos>
<bos>Well, I think that Darlene<eol>has a very active imagination.<eos>
<bos>I've been listening to those stories<eos>
<bos>since the first grade.<eos>
<bos>So, basically, you ignored her statement.<eos>
<bos>I included it in my report.<eos>
<bos>But you didn't bother to check it out.<eos>
<bos>We went out to the campsite.<eos>
<bos>We didn't find anything.<eos>
<bos>Let me tell you something.<eos>
<bos>Darlene's little girl was no prom queen.<eos>
<bos>I can't count the number of times<eos>
<bos>I pulled her out of parked cars<eos>
<bos>or found her puking her guts out<eol>by the side of the road.<eos>
<bos>It was just a matter of time before...<eos>
<bos>Before what?<eos>
<bos>Before something bad happened to her.<eos>
<bos>And if Darlene needs<eol>to make up crazy stories<eos>
<bos>to get past that, fine,<eos>
<bos>but don't tell me<eol>to treat it as the truth.<eos>
<bos>I'm not going to waste my time.<eos>
<bos>I just think it's a good idea<eos>
<bos>not to antagonize local law enforcement.<eos>
<bos>Who? Me?<eos>
<bos>I'm Mr. Congeniality.<eos>
<bos>You never know-- we might need his help<eos>
<bos>one of these days.<eos>
<bos>I'll send him a Bundt cake.<eos>
<bos>You're looking for Ruby, right?<eos>
<bos>That's right.<eos>
<bos>Who are you?<eos>
<bos>Doesn't matter.<eos>
<bos>Are you a friend of Ruby's?<eos>
<bos>Ruby didn't have friends.<eos>
<bos>She just had people<eol>she liked to hang with.<eos>
<bos>And she liked to hang out with you?<eos>
<bos>I guess we had some times.<eos>
<bos>Like the night she disappeared?<eos>
<bos>It was Greg.<eos>
<bos>She was supposed to see him that night.<eos>
<bos>Who's Greg?<eos>
<bos>Her boyfriend, Greg Randall.<eos>
<bos>They were supposed to meet<eol>up at the lake.<eos>
<bos>They had stuff to talk about.<eos>
<bos>What kind of stuff?<eos>
<bos>Greg got Ruby pregnant.<eos>
<bos>I don't know, whatever,<eol>she got herself pregnant.<eos>
<bos>Do you know what they<eol>were planning to do about it?<eos>
<bos>They were going to leave town.<eos>
<bos>At least, that's what Ruby told me.<eos>
<bos>You know Greg from school?<eos>
<bos>Greg? School?<eos>
<bos>I don't think so.<eos>
<bos>All he ever did since we met him<eos>
<bos>was pour beer at the Pennsylvania pub.<eos>
<bos>Excuse me.<eos>
<bos>Do you know where<eol>we could find Greg Randall?<eos>
<bos>Who's asking?<eos>
<bos>What kind of trouble's<eol>he got himself into now?<eos>
<bos>Actually, we were hoping<eol>you could tell us.<eos>
<bos>Greg called in sick<eol>about three weeks ago, man.<eos>
<bos>I haven't seen or heard from him since.<eos>
<bos>Any ideas where he might have gone?<eos>
<bos>No, but if you find him,<eol>you tell him he's fired.<eos>
<bos>This is the hotel we'll be staying at<eos>
<bos>if you hear of anything.<eos>
<bos>Hey, that's a nice tattoo.<eos>
<bos>What is that?<eos>
<bos>What's it look like?<eos>
<bos>A flying saucer.<eos>
<bos>You don't really believe<eol>in that stuff, do you?<eos>
<bos>I take it you don't?<eos>
<bos>No, I think it's all<eol>just a bunch of crazy people<eos>
<bos>howling at the moon.<eos>
<bos>So, you haven't been out<eol>to Lake Okobogee, have you?<eos>
<bos>No, I haven't. Why?<eos>
<bos>You should ride with us sometime.<eos>
<bos>You might see some things<eol>that will change your mind.<eos>
<bos>Get a killer sunburn<eol>in the middle of the night.<eos>
<bos>Where's Mulder?<eos>
<bos>Where did you get the document?<eos>
<bos>If you explain to me what<eol>you're talking about,<eos>
<bos>maybe I can help you out.<eos>
<bos>This is a document?<eos>
<bos>Just looks like a bunch<eol>of ones and zeroes to me.<eos>
<bos>Tell me where you got it.<eos>
<bos>Tell me what it is.<eos>
<bos>Keep playing games, Mulder,<eos>
<bos>I'll haul your ass<eol>up in front of the D-6.<eos>
<bos>You can explain to them<eos>
<bos>what you're doing obstructing justice.<eos>
<bos>It's your call, Holtzman.<eos>
<bos>Unless they tell me otherwise,<eos>
<bos>I'm not accountable to anybody<eol>outside my subcommittee.<eos>
<bos>I don't care if it's the NSA<eol>or the Vatican police.<eos>
<bos>It's a defense satellite transmission.<eos>
<bos>You're kidding.<eos>
<bos>Just a fragment, but highly classified.<eos>
<bos>We need to know where it came from.<eos>
<bos>Well, sure, I'll let you know<eol>as soon as I find out.<eos>
<bos>That's it, Mulder.<eos>
<bos>You just bought yourself a one-way<eos>
<bos>back to Washington.<eos>
<bos>We got it.<eos>
<bos>Great.<eos>
<bos>What?<eos>
<bos>You shouldn't have told them.<eos>
<bos>They have no jurisdiction.<eos>
<bos>Mulder, they're NSA.<eos>
<bos>They think the boy<eos>
<bos>may be a threat to national security.<eos>
<bos>Come on. How can an eight-year-old boy<eos>
<bos>who can barely multiply<eos>
<bos>be a threat to national security?<eos>
<bos>People call me paranoid.<eos>
<bos>Well, how did Kevin obtain<eol>top-secret information?<eos>
<bos>I mean, where do you think<eol>he got it from?<eos>
<bos>Watch your step, ma'am.<eos>
<bos>It's okay, baby.<eos>
<bos>Don't worry.<eos>
<bos>It will be okay.<eos>
<bos>AGENT: Come with me, son.<eos>
<bos>Mom!<eos>
<bos>Get in the car, please, ma'am.<eos>
<bos>It will be all right, baby.<eos>
<bos>Watch your head, please.<eos>
<bos>You guys do really delicate work.<eos>
<bos>Let's get this to cryptography.<eos>
<bos>Let's go.<eos>
<bos>Think we got what we needed.<eos>
<bos>Thank you.<eos>
<bos>What is it?<eos>
<bos>I'm not sure.<eos>
<bos>We scanned all 77 pages<eos>
<bos>through the mainframe in Washington.<eos>
<bos>And none of the information<eol>is actionable?<eos>
<bos>Other than the satellite transmission,<eos>
<bos>nothing can be construed in any way<eos>
<bos>as a national security risk.<eos>
<bos>As far as I know, the boy's<eol>being released this afternoon.<eos>
<bos>So it was just a random set<eol>of ones and zeroes?<eos>
<bos>On the contrary, there was<eol>nothing random about it.<eos>
<bos>I don't understand.<eos>
<bos>All information can be rendered digitally<eos>
<bos>in a series of ones and zeroes.<eos>
<bos>When we downloaded the data,<eol>we found an amazing range of...<eos>
<bos>Well, see for yourself.<eos>
<bos>Da Vinci's Universal Man.<eos>
<bos>A DNA double helix.<eos>
<bos>There's lots more.<eos>
<bos>That's from the Brandenburg concertos.<eos>
<bos>But they're just fragments.<eos>
<bos>A few notes here, a few notes there,<eos>
<bos>some lines from the Koran,<eol>a Shakespearean sonnet...<eos>
<bos>Almost like someone<eol>switching channels, huh?<eos>
<bos>Mrs. Morris...<eos>
<bos>I have nothing to say to you.<eos>
<bos>Mrs. Morris, please,<eol>give me a minute to explain.<eos>
<bos>Would you please just wait<eol>right over there for Mama?<eos>
<bos>I'll be right there.<eos>
<bos>I thought you were both supposed<eol>to be here to help us.<eos>
<bos>This has been a terrible mistake,<eos>
<bos>and I assure you that the government<eos>
<bos>will pay for all repairs and damages.<eos>
<bos>I don't want your money.<eos>
<bos>I want my daughter back,<eos>
<bos>and I want you to leave us alone.<eos>
<bos>But your son has seen something.<eos>
<bos>You stay away from me,<eol>and you stay away from my child.<eos>
<bos>Come on, honey.<eos>
<bos>It's okay. Let's go now.<eos>
<bos>I thought we were headed back into town.<eos>
<bos>Where are we going?<eos>
<bos>The boy's the key, Scully.<eos>
<bos>I know it.<eos>
<bos>The key to what?<eos>
<bos>Finding Ruby.<eos>
<bos>Just think about it for a minute.<eos>
<bos>This is a boy<eos>
<bos>who is receiving all kinds<eol>of digitized data<eos>
<bos>from a television screen.<eos>
<bos>Agent Atsumi said it was<eol>a statistical aberration.<eos>
<bos>No.<eos>
<bos>Okay, I admit it's not much<eol>of an explanation, but...<eos>
<bos>I think that Kevin<eol>is a conduit of some kind.<eos>
<bos>A conduit.<eos>
<bos>A link or a connection to whoever...<eos>
<bos>or whatever took Ruby that night.<eos>
<bos>But how?<eos>
<bos>If there was an abduction,<eos>
<bos>it's likely that Kevin<eol>was touched in some way.<eos>
<bos>Mulder, I know what you're thinking.<eos>
<bos>I know why this is so important to you.<eos>
<bos>I know.<eos>
<bos>But there is no evidence<eol>indicating an abduction.<eos>
<bos>That's why we're going to Lake Okobogee.<eos>
<bos>According to the police photos,<eos>
<bos>Ruby and Kevin were sleeping right here.<eos>
<bos>Just a stone's throw<eol>from the forest wall.<eos>
<bos>Meaning what?<eos>
<bos>Meaning anybody<eos>
<bos>could have come out of<eol>the forest to grab her.<eos>
<bos>Have you noticed the tree line?<eos>
<bos>Evidence of extreme heat.<eos>
<bos>Or an electrical storm.<eos>
<bos>Besides which, there's nothing<eos>
<bos>to connect it to the night<eos>
<bos>of Ruby's disappearance.<eos>
<bos>That's true.<eos>
<bos>Do you think a lightning strike<eos>
<bos>could have caused this?<eos>
<bos>Do you have any idea at what temperature<eos>
<bos>sand solidifies into glass?<eos>
<bos>2,500 degrees Fahrenheit.<eos>
<bos>Something was out here, Scully--<eos>
<bos>something hot enough to<eol>turn sand into glass,<eos>
<bos>to singe those trees<eos>
<bos>and to blister the roof of that camper.<eos>
<bos>Mulder...<eos>
<bos>look.<eos>
<bos>What is it?<eos>
<bos>It's a grave.<eos>
<bos>Shallow, by the smell of it.<eos>
<bos>Mulder, what are you doing?<eos>
<bos>Mulder, you are disturbing a crime scene.<eos>
<bos>Stop!<eos>
<bos>What if it's her?<eos>
<bos>I need to know.<eos>
<bos>You okay, Mulder?<eos>
<bos>I'm fine.<eos>
<bos>Looks like a male Caucasian.<eos>
<bos>Sir.<eos>
<bos>Victim's name was Greg Randall.<eos>
<bos>Ruby's boyfriend.<eos>
<bos>Ruby had a lot of boyfriends.<eos>
<bos>Before you put that away,<eol>can I take a look at it?<eos>
<bos>Go right ahead.<eos>
<bos>Look at that.<eos>
<bos>That's her-- the girl from the library.<eos>
<bos>Who?<eos>
<bos>We didn't get her name,<eos>
<bos>but she claimed Greg and<eol>Ruby had run off together.<eos>
<bos>Well, Doc Fowler's a buddy of mine.<eos>
<bos>Delivered both my kids.<eos>
<bos>I can find out who had that appointment.<eos>
<bos>Have a seat, Tessa.<eos>
<bos>We know that you lied to us<eol>the other day.<eos>
<bos>We know that you had the appointment<eos>
<bos>with Dr. Fowler on August 7.<eos>
<bos>We know that you're the one<eol>that's pregnant, not Ruby.<eos>
<bos>You don't know nothing, do you?<eos>
<bos>We can prove it, Tessa,<eos>
<bos>and we can prove that<eol>Greg was the father.<eos>
<bos>So what if he was the father?<eos>
<bos>This is very serious.<eos>
<bos>Do you understand how serious this is?<eos>
<bos>Now, you've waived the<eol>right to an attorney.<eos>
<bos>So if you lie to us here today,<eos>
<bos>you could be charged with perjury.<eos>
<bos>He promised me we'd be in L.A.<eol>by Christmas.<eos>
<bos>He had a friend there.<eos>
<bos>And I'd never seen the ocean.<eos>
<bos>You said that he and Ruby<eol>were seeing each other.<eos>
<bos>You said that they were planning<eos>
<bos>to meet at the lake.<eos>
<bos>Is that true?<eos>
<bos>Look, I was nowhere near<eol>the lake that night, okay?<eos>
<bos>Sure you were, Tessa.<eos>
<bos>You knew they were meeting,<eos>
<bos>so you sat there and you waited for them.<eos>
<bos>You were angry and you were jealous.<eos>
<bos>I wasn't. You sat there,<eos>
<bos>and you waited, and when they showed,<eos>
<bos>you killed him first.<eol>Isn't that how it went?<eos>
<bos>and you shot him in the back.<eos>
<bos>Bam!<eos>
<bos>And then you killed Ruby.<eos>
<bos>Bam!<eos>
<bos>What was she doing<eol>right before she died, Tessa?<eos>
<bos>Was she pleading for her life?<eos>
<bos>Was she running away?<eos>
<bos>I didn't kill her!<eos>
<bos>Where's she buried, Tessa?<eos>
<bos>I don't know!<eos>
<bos>You don't know<eol>where you buried her, Tessa?<eos>
<bos>I didn't kill her! You didn't?<eos>
<bos>She wasn't even there that night!<eos>
<bos>Well, how would you know that, Tessa,<eos>
<bos>if you weren't there yourself?<eos>
<bos>Mulder, you're not seeing<eol>the whole picture here.<eos>
<bos>Which is?<eos>
<bos>Which is that,<eol>in all likelihood, Ruby is dead.<eos>
<bos>Is that your conclusion or the conclusion<eos>
<bos>of the Sioux City Sheriff's Department?<eos>
<bos>They're searching the national park,<eos>
<bos>and a rescue dive team<eol>is coming in from Des Moines<eos>
<bos>to drag the lake.<eos>
<bos>They're wasting their time.<eos>
<bos>Do you really think Tessa Sears<eol>is telling the truth?<eos>
<bos>Why not?<eos>
<bos>What if Ruby never did<eol>show up that night?<eos>
<bos>She lied to us in the library.<eos>
<bos>She lied to us about her pregnancy.<eos>
<bos>What makes you think<eos>
<bos>she wouldn't lie to us<eol>about killing Ruby?<eos>
<bos>Because something<eol>was out there in those woods.<eos>
<bos>We have a suspect in custody.<eos>
<bos>We have a confession to one murder,<eos>
<bos>and we have a statement<eos>
<bos>which speaks to the intent<eol>to commit another.<eos>
<bos>It's over, Mulder.<eos>
<bos>It's time to go home<eos>
<bos>and turn this over<eol>to local law enforcement.<eos>
<bos>I can't do that.<eos>
<bos>Mulder, where are you going?<eos>
<bos>To talk to the boy.<eos>
<bos>Darlene won't even let you in the door.<eos>
<bos>Well, I've got to see him.<eos>
<bos>They don't want to have<eol>anything to do with us.<eos>
<bos>Mulder, stop.<eos>
<bos>Stop running after your sister.<eos>
<bos>This won't bring her back.<eos>
<bos>Come with me, or don't come with me,<eos>
<bos>but until they find a body,<eol>I'm not giving up on that girl.<eos>
<bos>Hello?<eos>
<bos>Mrs. Morris?<eos>
<bos>Kevin?<eos>
<bos>Mulder?<eos>
<bos>What does it mean?<eos>
<bos>I don't know.<eos>
<bos>I'm going to check upstairs.<eos>
<bos>Oh, my God.<eos>
<bos>What is it?<eos>
<bos>Just come up here.<eos>
<bos>Look.<eos>
<bos>It's her.<eos>
<bos>It's Ruby.<eos>
<bos>This is a long shot, Mulder.<eos>
<bos>They could be anywhere.<eos>
<bos>You know, when I was a kid,<eos>
<bos>I had this ritual.<eos>
<bos>I'd close my eyes<eol>before I walked into my room<eos>
<bos>because I thought that,<eol>one day, when I opened them,<eos>
<bos>my sister would be there<eos>
<bos>just lying in bed, like<eol>nothing ever happened.<eos>
<bos>You know, I'm still<eol>walking into that room...<eos>
<bos>every day of my life.<eos>
<bos>Scully!<eos>
<bos>Darlene!<eos>
<bos>Look. There's a trail ahead.<eos>
<bos>Are you okay?<eos>
<bos>It's here. I saw it.<eos>
<bos>Where's Kevin?<eos>
<bos>I couldn't keep up with him.<eos>
<bos>Go ahead.<eos>
<bos>Kevin!<eos>
<bos>Are you okay?<eos>
<bos>She's back.<eos>
<bos>Kevin, I'm sorry, but I don't...<eos>
<bos>She's here. I know it.<eos>
<bos>Kevin, I don't think she is.<eos>
<bos>I know how much you wanted it to be her.<eos>
<bos>I did, too. Mulder!<eos>
<bos>Come on.<eos>
<bos>Scully!<eos>
<bos>Ruby!<eos>
<bos>She's unconscious, but she's still alive.<eos>
<bos>I'll get help.<eos>
<bos>Nurse says she's been<eol>awake for almost an hour.<eos>
<bos>Any ideas what caused the coma?<eos>
<bos>Uh, there's no sign of head trauma.<eos>
<bos>No narcotic traces, or<eol>electrolyte abnormalities<eos>
<bos>except her white blood cell<eol>count was sky-high.<eos>
<bos>By any chance, was there<eol>an attendant reduction<eos>
<bos>in the lymphocyte population<eos>
<bos>or release of glucocorticoids?<eos>
<bos>Um...<eos>
<bos>actually, both.<eos>
<bos>How did you know that?<eos>
<bos>They're symptoms<eol>of prolonged weightlessness.<eos>
<bos>Shuttle astronauts have reported<eol>similar imbalances.<eos>
<bos>Hi.<eos>
<bos>Hi, Ruby.<eos>
<bos>Who are you?<eos>
<bos>We're with the FBI.<eos>
<bos>I'm Special Agent Dana Scully,<eol>and this is Fox Mulder.<eos>
<bos>My mom said you might be coming by.<eos>
<bos>How are you feeling?<eos>
<bos>Fine, I guess.<eos>
<bos>Where were you, Ruby?<eos>
<bos>Can you tell us?<eos>
<bos>KEVIN: It's okay, Ruby.<eos>
<bos>He knows.<eos>
<bos>I'm not supposed to tell.<eos>
<bos>They told me not to say.<eos>
<bos>Who told you?<eos>
<bos>Ruby, who told you?<eos>
<bos>Sweetheart,<eos>
<bos>you don't have to say anything.<eos>
<bos>You're right.<eos>
<bos>We should wait till<eol>Ruby gets a little stronger.<eos>
<bos>Can we speak outside for a moment?<eos>
<bos>I think that it's best<eos>
<bos>that we put all of this behind us.<eos>
<bos>I mean, hasn't Ruby<eol>been through enough already?<eos>
<bos>I know how disoriented<eol>she must seem right now,<eos>
<bos>but in a couple weeks, maybe<eol>even a few days, we could...<eos>
<bos>I don't want her<eol>talking to you or anyone.<eos>
<bos>She should be encouraged<eol>to tell her story,<eos>
<bos>not to keep it inside.<eos>
<bos>It's important that you let her.<eos>
<bos>Important to who?<eos>
<bos>I have my daughter back.<eos>
<bos>I don't want any more trouble.<eos>
<bos>Besides, she can hardly<eol>remember anything.<eos>
<bos>She will remember one day,<eos>
<bos>one way or another,<eol>even if it's only in dreams.<eos>
<bos>And when she does, she's going<eol>to want to talk about it.<eos>
<bos>She's going to need to talk about it.<eos>
<bos>Like I did?<eos>
<bos>Listen to me.<eos>
<bos>All of my life, I have been ridiculed<eos>
<bos>for speaking my mind.<eos>
<bos>But it was the truth, Darlene.<eos>
<bos>The truth has caused me<eol>nothing but heartache.<eos>
<bos>I don't want the same thing for her.<eos>
<bos>It doesn't have to be that way for Ruby.<eos>
<bos>As far as I'm concerned,<eol>she spent the last month<eos>
<bos>on the back of a Harley-Davidson.<eos>
<bos>Is that what you're going to tell Kevin?<eos>
<bos>I'm sorry.<eos>
<bos>But your eyes are open?<eos>
<bos>Yeah, they're open,<eos>
<bos>but it's like nothing's happening.<eos>
<bos>Try turning your head.<eos>
<bos>I can't.<eos>
<bos>Why not?<eos>
<bos>I don't know.<eos>
<bos>I can't move.<eos>
<bos>So I don't.<eos>
<bos>I just lie there in bed.<eos>
<bos>Can you see your sister?<eos>
<bos>No.<eos>
<bos>But I can hear her.<eos>
<bos>What is she saying?<eos>
<bos>She's calling out my name<eos>
<bos>over and over again.<eos>
<bos>She's crying out for help,<eos>
<bos>but I can't help her.<eos>
<bos>I can't move.<eos>
<bos>Are you scared?<eos>
<bos>I know I should be, but I'm not.<eos>
<bos>Do you know why?<eos>
<bos>Because of the voice.<eos>
<bos>The voice?<eos>
<bos>The voice in my head.<eos>
<bos>What's it telling you?<eos>
<bos>Not to be afraid.<eos>
<bos>It's telling me that no harm<eol>will come to her<eos>
<bos>and that, one day, she'll return.<eos>
<bos>Do you believe the voice?<eos>
<bos>I want to believe.<eos>
