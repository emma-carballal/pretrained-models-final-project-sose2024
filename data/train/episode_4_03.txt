<bos>Where did you find them?<eos>
<bos>Look, at least tell us<eos>

<bos>That might help us<eol>determine why the bodies<eos>
<bos>haven't cooled.<eos>
<bos>You guys called us down here.<eos>

<bos>They traveled 60 minutes by air.<eos>
<bos>Thankyou.<eos>
<bos>The most troubling aspect ofthe deaths<eos>
<bos>is the throat area.<eos>
<bos>Larynx, esophagus, and hyoid bone--<eos>
<bos>all have been crushed<eos>
<bos>like chalk.<eos>
<bos>No abrasions, or evidence<eol>oftissue damage.<eos>
<bos>lt's as iftheir throats were crushed<eos>
<bos>from the inside.<eos>
<bos>Who are these guys?<eos>

<bos>in a campaign ofmisinformation.<eos>
<bos>Who doyou think theywere?<eos>
<bos>N.S.A., C.l.A., some covert organization<eos>
<bos>that Congress will uncover<eol>in the next scandal.<eos>
<bos>lt's not important who they are<eos>
<bos>but what they have.<eos>
<bos>l'm sure they have no idea,<eol>because they called us in.<eos>
<bos>l have X-Files--<eos>
<bos>each case has an element<eol>ofwhat we saw tonight.<eos>
<bos>Residual electrostatic charge,<eol>internal mutilation--<eos>
<bos>none has the elements<eol>combined in one case.<eos>
<bos>How can an esophagus be crushed<eol>without the neck being touched?<eos>
<bos>Psychokinetic manipulation.<eos>

<bos>Okay, l'm intrigued<eol>but how can we investigate?<eos>

<bos>ten years ago.<eos>
<bos>As long as l knew him<eos>
<bos>he had no interest<eol>in anything besides work.<eos>
<bos>So, some ofus<eos>

<bos>No witnesses?<eos>
<bos>The kind ofpeople<eos>
<bos>who come around here after business hours<eos>
<bos>don't witness very much.<eos>
<bos>You know what l'm saying.<eos>
<bos>We'll just question everyone on record<eos>

<bos>Whywould the lsfahan be<eol>robbing someone of40 bucks<eos>
<bos>at an ATM machine?<eos>
<bos>Look at that.<eos>
<bos>Maybe it's another person.<eos>
<bos>Maybe. Maybe not.<eos>
<bos>Well, the resolution's too poor.<eos>

<bos>That leaves us only one person<eos>
<bos>we know we can talk to.<eos>

<bos>Theywere found dead.<eos>
<bos>Haveyou ever seen this person before?<eos>
<bos>No.<eos>
<bos>l'm sorry. l can't tell you.<eos>

<bos>Uh... lt means l...<eos>
<bos>l can't tell you who it is.<eos>
<bos>Well, when you can tell me<eos>
<bos>this is the number<eos>
<bos>l can be reached at any time, okay?<eos>
<bos>Mm-hmm.<eos>
<bos>A woman her size breaking free<eos>
<bos>and outrunning those men?<eos>
<bos>Then somehow crushing their necks?<eos>
<bos>Scully: She knows who<eos>
<bos>the other person in the photo is.<eos>
<bos>She's packing, running away,<eol>but from what?<eos>

<bos>What's happening?<eol>What the hell's going on?<eos>
<bos>Mulder: Hang on!<eos>

<bos>Hi.<eos>
<bos>Hi.<eos>
<bos>The paramedics checkyou out?<eos>
<bos>Yeah. l'm fine, although l do have<eos>
<bos>a standing-in-line-<eol>at-the-DMV-sized headache.<eos>
<bos>Mine's more l.R.S.-sized.<eos>
<bos>Did they check out the car?<eos>
<bos>lt's brand-new. only 1 00 miles.<eos>
<bos>Then someone tampered with it<eos>
<bos>while we were in her house.<eos>
<bos>The mechanic says<eol>everything's in proper order.<eos>
<bos>Nothing cut, nothing greased.<eos>
<bos>Check out the lights.<eos>
<bos>They're on.<eos>
<bos>No. The filaments are heated<eos>
<bos>due to massive levels<eol>ofelectrostatic charge<eos>
<bos>just like the bodies in the morgue.<eos>
<bos>And isn't it interesting that Lauren Kyte<eos>
<bos>was present at both incidents?<eos>
<bos>She was in our presence the entire time.<eos>
<bos>What ifit's possible<eos>
<bos>to raise the body's electrostatic charge<eos>
<bos>to the levels we've been seeing<eos>
<bos>and use that energy to affect objects?<eos>
<bos>lfa person generated that much energy<eos>
<bos>their body would break down.<eos>
<bos>They'd glow like those lights.<eos>
<bos>There's evidence ofthis in the X-Files--<eos>
<bos>furniture moving untouched<eos>
<bos>objects levitating<eos>
<bos>unexplained electrical discharges.<eos>
<bos>Frequently, people who have<eol>psychokinetic power<eos>
<bos>are unaware oftheir own capability.<eos>
<bos>Areyou saying<eol>Lauren Kyte crashed our car?<eos>
<bos>Either that...<eos>
<bos>or a poltergeist.<eos>
<bos>They're here.<eos>
<bos>They may be.<eos>
<bos>Mulder, look at<eos>
<bos>the tangible evidence.<eos>
<bos>Two mideast extremists were killed<eos>
<bos>trying to assault a woman<eos>
<bos>working for a manufacturer ofparts<eos>
<bos>for the Defense Department.<eos>
<bos>When we questioned her,<eol>our carwas sabotaged.<eos>
<bos>ln both cases, someone else<eol>may have committed those acts--<eos>
<bos>Maybe the same someone<eol>from the ATM photos.<eos>
<bos>The mystery isn't psychokinetic energy.<eos>
<bos>lt's her accomplice.<eos>
<bos>Excuse me.<eos>
<bos>She's clean. No arrest,<eol>not even a traffic ticket.<eos>
<bos>The only thing is<eos>
<bos>she's in deep with her<eol>credit card company-- 1 5,000.<eos>
<bos>What doyou think you're doing?<eos>
<bos>No, no. l'll take care ofthis, all right?<eos>
<bos>Here. l'll talk to somebody.<eos>
<bos>wouldn'tyou say?<eos>
<bos>Who is Howard Graves, anyway?<eos>
<bos>She was his secretary.<eos>
<bos>That's three people dead<eol>in the last month<eos>
<bos>associated with Lauren Kyte.<eos>
<bos>You won't find too many people<eos>
<bos>at their boss' grave<eol>who aren't dancing on it.<eos>
<bos>Look at this one.<eos>

<bos>where l can get some information<eos>

<bos>l think Howard Graves<eol>fabricated his own death.<eos>
<bos>Doyou know how difficult it is<eos>
<bos>to fakeyour own death?<eos>
<bos>Only one man has pulled it off-- Elvis.<eos>
<bos>He and Lauren Kyte are in on something.<eos>
<bos>Maybe an illegal dealing<eol>through his company--<eos>
<bos>something the C.l.A. was interested in.<eos>
<bos>You may be right.<eos>
<bos>Wait.<eos>
<bos>You think l'm right?<eos>
<bos>Sure. All you got to do<eos>
<bos>is prove Howard Graves is still alive.<eos>

<bos>How did you know?<eos>
<bos>lt said so on the toe tag.<eos>
<bos>Who made positive l.D. on the body?<eos>
<bos>Um...<eos>
<bos>Lauren Kyte.<eos>
<bos>Mulder: But he was cremated.<eos>
<bos>There's no way to run a dental check<eos>
<bos>or get a DNA sample.<eos>
<bos>Yes, there is.<eos>
<bos>His body's tissues and organs<eol>were donated.<eos>
<bos>They harvested the organs<eol>immediately after death.<eos>
<bos>His kidneys were sent to Boston<eos>
<bos>his liver to Dallas<eos>
<bos>and his corneas to Portland, Oregon.<eos>
<bos>They've all been transplanted.<eos>
<bos>Because ofhis age<eos>
<bos>we could only cryopreserve<eol>the dura matter<eos>
<bos>in the membrane ofthe spinal column.<eos>
<bos>We have Mr. Graves' hospital records.<eos>
<bos>We'll extract a sample, run a test<eos>
<bos>l, uh, made them rush<eol>soyou could haveyour check<eos>
<bos>beforeyou leave.<eos>
<bos>Oh. l'm going to miss you.<eos>
<bos>Oh.<eos>
<bos>Oh, what?<eos>

<bos>You were going to leave<eos>
<bos>without saying good-bye?<eos>
<bos>Well, uh, l came to say good-bye<eos>
<bos>and to wish you luck...<eos>
<bos>and to leaveyou with this little thought.<eos>
<bos>l know Howard told you<eos>
<bos>and ifit ever gets out<eos>
<bos>l won't waste my time<eol>trying to pin the source.<eos>
<bos>l'll go straight toyou.<eos>
<bos>And you'll do to me whatyou did<eos>

<bos>You know, you're not under arrest.<eos>
<bos>You'rejust here for questioning.<eos>
<bos>The sooner you talk to us<eos>
<bos>the sooner you get to go home.<eos>
<bos>What happened<eos>
<bos>to those people tonight?<eos>
<bos>Doyou have any idea who they might be?<eos>
<bos>Why did they attackyou?<eos>
<bos>Doyou know who this is?<eos>
<bos>Scully, Mulder.<eos>
<bos>He'll keep an eye on her.<eos>
<bos>Come on. Now.<eos>
<bos>You've seriously compromised<eol>our investigation.<eos>
<bos>We were following leads<eol>pertaining to an X-File.<eos>
<bos>l want to know every detail<eol>ofyour activities<eos>
<bos>concerning this case.<eos>
<bos>You're the ones who have been<eos>
<bos>withholding information.<eos>
<bos>Why don'tyou tell us whatyou've got?<eos>
<bos>Then we have nothing more to talk about.<eos>
<bos>Wait! We believe H.T.G.<eos>
<bos>lndustrial Technologies<eol>sold restricted parts<eos>
<bos>to the lsfahan.<eos>
<bos>Serial numbers were recovered<eol>in the wreckage<eos>
<bos>ofthe bombing ofa navy transport van.<eos>
<bos>How is Lauren Kyte involved?<eos>
<bos>Your actions impeded our investigation.<eos>
<bos>We don't have enough evidence<eol>to hold her.<eos>
<bos>lfshe doesn't talk, she goes free<eos>
<bos>and we lose our chance<eol>to break this company.<eos>
<bos>l could make her talk.<eos>
<bos>My advice toyou:<eol>don't get rough with her.<eos>
<bos>That was a waste oftime.<eos>
<bos>Your turn.<eos>
<bos>Lauren...<eos>
<bos>l won't talk toyou either.<eos>
<bos>Okay. Then you're free to go.<eos>
<bos>l can't go back to that house.<eos>
<bos>Why?<eos>
<bos>Because of Howard Graves?<eos>
<bos>He's dead.<eos>
<bos>l know.<eos>
<bos>He's watching overyou, isn't he?<eos>
<bos>Sometimes your boss can talk<eos>
<bos>as ifyou weren't even in the room<eos>
<bos>which can hurt, you know.<eos>
<bos>Sometimes you're all he has to talk to<eos>
<bos>which is how it always was<eol>with me and Howard.<eos>
<bos>One night, late, l went into his office.<eos>
<bos>He was crying, more scared than sad.<eos>
<bos>The Pentagon contracts<eol>were being canceled.<eos>
<bos>The companywas going under.<eos>
<bos>He felt personally responsible<eol>for each ofhis employees.<eos>
<bos>Seeing and feeling their fear every day<eos>
<bos>reallywore him down.<eos>
<bos>Then this one time,<eol>Dorlund came with that group--<eos>
<bos>that mideast group-- lsfahan.<eos>
<bos>They'd buy parts at an outrageous price--<eos>
<bos>notjust once--<eos>
<bos>for as long as they<eol>could get awaywith it.<eos>
<bos>That night Howard was crying,<eol>he hadjust found out<eos>
<bos>that lsfahan had claimed responsibility<eos>
<bos>for killing a couple sailors in Florida.<eos>
<bos>He was never the same<eos>
<bos>and l thought<eol>that's why he killed himself...<eos>
<bos>but he didn't.<eos>
<bos>l saw...<eos>
<bos>Howard showed me how<eol>Dorlund had him killed.<eos>
<bos>Made it look like a suicide,<eol>'cause he could see<eos>
<bos>Howard was going<eol>to put an end to the deal.<eos>
<bos>So now Howard is protecting you?<eos>
<bos>lt sounds so ridiculous.<eos>
<bos>Butyou believe it?<eos>
<bos>He was closer to me than my father.<eos>
<bos>l told him that.<eos>
<bos>l still feel his presence.<eos>
<bos>Sometimes...<eol>l even smell his after-shave.<eos>
<bos>lfyoujust could have... seen<eol>the things l've seen.<eos>
<bos>l just want all that to go away.<eos>
<bos>That's why l'm leaving.<eos>
<bos>Maybe he can move on.<eos>
<bos>That's not enough.<eos>
<bos>You have been given the chance<eol>to tell him again.<eos>
<bos>Take it.<eos>
<bos>Tell him you love him by showing him...<eos>
<bos>by... by helping us finish<eol>his unfinished business.<eos>
<bos>Lauren, how will you ever<eos>
<bos>be able to rest ifhe never can?<eos>
<bos>Okay.<eos>
<bos>l'm a mess.<eos>
<bos>l'm going to, uh... wash up.<eos>
<bos>What areyou doing, Scully?<eos>
<bos>You don't believe.<eos>
<bos>Mulder, there's no such things<eol>as ghosts or psychokinesis.<eos>
<bos>l'm sure there's an explanation,<eol>but l believe that she believes<eos>
<bos>and my priority is to get her<eol>to help us stop Dorlund.<eos>
<bos>Well, we may havejust<eol>sacrificed our best opportunity<eos>
<bos>to observe spectral phenomena.<eos>
<bos>No, l'm giving us the chance<eol>to solve a case that's tangible<eos>
<bos>instead ofchasing after shadows.<eos>

<bos>Areyou ready?<eos>
<bos>All right, everyone<eos>
<bos>we have a warrant to search the premises<eos>
<bos>for evidence pertaining to the sale<eos>
<bos>ofrestricted manufactured parts.<eos>
<bos>The evidence may be in the form<eos>
<bos>offalsified export licenses,<eol>parts manifests, communiques.<eos>
<bos>lt could be on computer disk<eol>or hard copy.<eos>
<bos>Once there, ifin doubt, ask.<eos>
<bos>We need this to be clean.<eos>
<bos>This is the culmination<eol>ofa yearlong investigation.<eos>
<bos>lfwe don't come out<eol>ofthere todaywith something<eos>
<bos>proving a connection to the lsfahan<eos>
<bos>this guy could walk.<eos>
<bos>Okay, let's go.<eos>

<bos>We'll execute the search,<eol>but we'll need you to guide us<eos>

<bos>Ma'am, could you back away<eol>from those files, please?<eos>
<bos>This is all we could find.<eos>
<bos>We don't have him.<eos>
<bos>He's not even breaking a sweat.<eos>
<bos>Webster: Our case is blown.<eos>
<bos>We've wasted a year.<eos>
<bos>This guy's going to walk.<eos>
<bos>Let's get out ofhere.<eos>
<bos>Mulder: Lauren, it's over. we have to go.<eos>
<bos>What we're looking for isn't here.<eos>
<bos>Dorlund: She's no agent.<eos>
<bos>l've been more than cooperative.<eos>
<bos>She has no right<eos>
<bos>to destroy my personal property.<eos>
<bos>What about that van that blew up<eol>and killed those servicemen?<eos>
<bos>l don't know whatyou're talking about<eos>
<bos>you stupid bitch!<eos>
<bos>Lauren, no!<eos>
<bos>Lauren: Don't kill him!<eos>
<bos>Help us find it!<eos>

<bos>Hey, Scully, doyou believe<eol>in an afterlife?<eos>
<bos>l'd settle for a life in this one.<eos>
<bos>You ever seen the Liberty Bell?<eos>
<bos>Yes.<eos>
<bos>l've been to Philadelphia 1 00 times<eos>
<bos>and l've never seen it.<eos>
<bos>You're not missing much.<eos>

<bos>and you have to wait in a long line.<eos>

<bos>Miss Kyte, l asked for this<eol>25 minutes ago.<eos>
<bos>l know. l'm sorry.<eos>
<bos>Maybe that's the way theywork back East<eos>
<bos>but here in the Midwest,<eol>punctuality is a virtue.<eos>
<bos>We really have to find<eol>a new office space.<eos>
<bos>Every time a truck goes by<eos>
<bos>the whole building shakes.<eos>
<bos>That's all, Lauren.<eos>
