<bos>Oh!<eos>
<bos>God!<eos>
<bos>That was...<eos>
<bos>That was incredible.<eos>
<bos>I mean it.<eos>
<bos>(panting)<eos>
<bos>You don't believe me.<eos>
<bos>Can you hear me?<eos>
<bos>Hey, l...<eos>
<bos>I don't even knowyour name.<eos>
<bos>Oh...<eos>
<bos>New York businessman calls<eol>his wife to say good night.<eos>
<bos>Then picks up some chippy.<eos>
<bos>Brings her back for sex.<eos>
<bos>Beyond that, nothing makes sense.<eos>
<bos>How's that?<eos>
<bos>Security monitor records the victim<eos>
<bos>entering with a woman at 1 0:1 3.<eos>
<bos>The same monitor records a male<eos>
<bos>Ieavingjust after midnight.<eos>
<bos>Couldn't she have changed clothes?<eos>
<bos>Thought ofthat.<eos>
<bos>Male is definitely a different person--<eos>
<bos>Short hair and at least<eol>30 pounds heavier.<eos>
<bos>No record ofhis entry<eos>
<bos>nor ofthe chippy leaving.<eos>
<bos>Scully: 30 foors up, no other egress.<eos>
<bos>Did the medical examiner<eol>establish a cause ofdeath?<eos>
<bos>Guy blew an artery.<eos>
<bos>Must have been some roll in the hay.<eos>
<bos>It's hard to imagine in this day and age<eos>
<bos>someone having sex<eol>with a perfect stranger.<eos>
<bos>Signs ofrobbery?<eos>
<bos>The male exited wearing<eos>
<bos>the victim's suit, carrying a suitcase<eos>
<bos>and the wallet's gone.<eos>
<bos>I don't even know whywe got this call.<eos>
<bos>Really.<eos>
<bos>Somebody at the Bureau<eos>
<bos>put out a memo requesting<eol>any case involving this C.O.D.<eos>
<bos>I assumed it was a...<eos>
<bos>Thanks for the call.<eos>
<bos>Five deaths, four in six weeks<eos>
<bos>between here and Boston.<eos>
<bos>In each case, the victim dies<eol>in the throes ofpassion.<eos>
<bos>Two women and three men,<eol>including the last one.<eos>
<bos>All young, healthy adults.<eos>
<bos>All with symptoms<eol>ofmassive coronary arrest.<eos>
<bos>A new drug on the streets?<eos>
<bos>The oldest drug-- not even illegal.<eos>
<bos>Each body showed<eol>huge amounts ofpheromones.<eos>
<bos>The chemicals animals secrete?<eos>
<bos>You mean sexual attractants.<eos>
<bos>Radar love-- a hundred times stronger<eos>
<bos>than found in nature.<eos>
<bos>Strong enough to produce<eos>
<bos>anaphylactic shock or a coronary.<eos>
<bos>Soyou think somebody<eol>is synthesizing them?<eos>
<bos>It's been done, but in nowhere<eol>near these concentrations<eos>
<bos>and, Scully, you're going to love this.<eos>
<bos>The pheromones we're talking about?<eos>
<bos>They contain human DNA.<eos>
<bos>Well, there's still a question<eos>
<bos>as to whether humans<eol>can produce pheromones<eos>
<bos>so how can that be?<eos>
<bos>I don't know, but ifit's true<eos>
<bos>this guy's a walking aphrodisiac.<eos>
<bos>He's the ultimate sex magnet.<eos>
<bos>He? Or she?<eos>
<bos>You've got victims ofboth sexes.<eos>
<bos>Both a man and a woman<eol>on the hotel security monitor.<eos>
<bos>That is a puzzle.<eos>
<bos>So what's our profile ofthe killer?<eos>
<bos>Indeterminate in height, weight, sex.<eos>
<bos>Unarmed, but extremely attractive.<eos>
<bos>It gets weirder.<eos>
<bos>There's been four deaths<eol>matching this M.O.<eos>
<bos>in the last six weeks.<eos>
<bos>In Boston, Hartford, Philadelphia<eos>
<bos>and here in Washington.<eos>
<bos>The killer's moving south.<eos>
<bos>There was a death I made<eol>a note ofabout a year ago<eos>
<bos>with the same symptoms.<eos>
<bos>A 32-year-old U.M.W. Iabor<eol>organizerwas found dead<eos>
<bos>outside a town called Steveston<eos>
<bos>in the woods of Massachusetts<eos>
<bos>home to a sect ofreligious isolationists<eos>
<bos>called the " Kindred."<eos>
<bos>Right. They live up there<eol>without electricity, phones<eos>
<bos>any modern amenities-- Iike the Amish.<eos>
<bos>The Kindred are known<eos>
<bos>for their handmade stoneware pottery.<eos>
<bos>They mine the clay.<eos>
<bos>What's so weird about that?<eos>
<bos>The white clay in those hills<eol>is particular to that region.<eos>
<bos>It's also the same substance<eos>
<bos>I scraped out ofthe scratches<eol>on the latest victim.<eos>
<bos>Wait. Aren't these people<eos>
<bos>famous for their abstinence<eol>and pure Christian ways?<eos>
<bos>Yes, but it looks as ifone ofthem forgot<eos>
<bos>to clean under his fingernails.<eos>
<bos>Hi.<eos>
<bos>This is Federal Agent Scully.<eos>
<bos>I'm Agent Mulder.<eos>
<bos>We're investigating a possible murder.<eos>
<bos>There aren't many killings around here.<eos>
<bos>What can you tell me about the Kindred?<eos>
<bos>They keep pretty much to themselves, huh?<eos>
<bos>Some folks say they're doing ceremonies--<eos>
<bos>voodoo or something.<eos>
<bos>I've got nothing against them myself.<eos>
<bos>They bring in the tourists.<eos>
<bos>They letyou take pictures?<eos>
<bos>Those are from back in the '30s.<eos>
<bos>What about the missing ones?<eos>
<bos>I'm having them reframed.<eol>They're under the counter.<eos>
<bos>Can I look at them?<eos>
<bos>Sure.<eos>
<bos>How would I get up to see them?<eos>
<bos>Well, they don't like<eol>strangers up there much.<eos>
<bos>The road's in pretty rough shape.<eos>
<bos>Steveston.<eos>
<bos>That's them now.<eos>
<bos>They usually shop at the feed store.<eos>
<bos>Whoa, boy.<eos>
<bos>Excuse me. Ladies.<eos>
<bos>I think I'm going to go inside.<eos>
<bos>You need anything from the feed store?<eos>
<bos>Hi.<eos>
<bos>She must have problems on the asphalt.<eos>
<bos>Has she ever thrown a shoe?<eos>
<bos>What's her name?<eos>
<bos>Alice.<eos>
<bos>That's sweet.<eos>
<bos>Did you name her?<eos>
<bos>We named her all together.<eos>
<bos>I'm not allowed to talk outside.<eos>
<bos>That's all right.<eos>
<bos>I'm Dana Scully.<eos>
<bos>I don't mean you any harm.<eos>
<bos>Scully, what areyou doing?<eos>
<bos>I wasjust talking.<eos>
<bos>You all right?<eos>
<bos>Yeah. I think so.<eos>
<bos>You want to sit down?<eos>
<bos>Interesting way oflife.<eos>
<bos>You get any sense about them?<eos>
<bos>There's something up there, Mulder.<eos>
<bos>I've been saying that foryears.<eos>
<bos>Oh, for a four-wheel drive.<eos>
<bos>Looks like about a mile walk.<eos>
<bos>Afteryou.<eos>
<bos>Now...<eos>
<bos>this... that's west.<eos>
<bos>What does the map say?<eos>
<bos>That we should be there already.<eos>
<bos>(sighs)<eos>
<bos>(stick breaking)<eos>
<bos>Mulder, look.<eos>
<bos>Hmm?<eos>
<bos>We're F.B.I. agents!<eos>
<bos>Federal police.<eos>
<bos>I'm Agent Mulder. This is Agent Scully.<eos>
<bos>We're investigating a murder.<eos>
<bos>I'm going to have to askyou<eos>
<bos>to remain at a distance.<eos>
<bos>Please, sir.<eos>
<bos>Man #1 : Yourweapons are forbidden here.<eos>
<bos>We can outlastyou at this spot.<eos>
<bos>You're not leaving until your guns<eos>
<bos>are handed to our council.<eos>
<bos>You will have them again as you leave.<eos>
<bos>We can't do that.<eos>
<bos>Woman: Please.<eos>
<bos>I'm SisterAbby. This is Brother Oakley.<eos>
<bos>We are all saddened<eos>
<bos>bywhat has happened in yourworld<eos>
<bos>but it does not concern us.<eos>
<bos>Up here, no one kills another, ever.<eos>
<bos>Wejust want to have<eol>a few questions answered.<eos>
<bos>Yourweapons are unwelcome here, notyou.<eos>
<bos>Come and praywith us. Be one ofus.<eos>
<bos>You'll see we harm no one.<eos>
<bos>Please relinquish yourweapons.<eos>
<bos>Please.<eos>
<bos>Now there is no reason to be afraid.<eos>
<bos>Come... sit.<eos>
<bos>Let us pray as one.<eos>
<bos>(man coughing)<eos>
<bos>SisterAbby:<eol>We who are separate give thanks<eos>
<bos>for our allotted time on this world.<eos>
<bos>We ask for strength<eos>
<bos>that we may bring forth<eol>the bounty that God<eos>
<bos>has provided.<eos>
<bos>Amen.<eos>
<bos>And we pray for the day ofthe coming<eos>
<bos>the moment ofour release.<eos>
<bos>All: Amen.<eos>
<bos>Let us eat.<eos>
<bos>I was wondering<eol>ifwe might ask a few questions.<eos>
<bos>We're looking for someone<eol>who may have come from here.<eos>
<bos>We have pictures.<eos>
<bos>We don't allow pictures.<eos>
<bos>A crime has been committed.<eos>
<bos>We have questions we need answered<eos>
<bos>ifyou'll forgive us.<eos>
<bos>What are these pictures?<eos>
<bos>Hotel securityvideos ofa man and a woman<eos>
<bos>who may have committed a murder.<eos>
<bos>Where was it committed?<eos>
<bos>In a hotel in Washington, D.C.<eos>
<bos>Mulder: lfyou look at the videotape<eos>
<bos>maybeyou can identify the individual.<eos>
<bos>How much violence has<eol>this person caused in yourworld?<eos>
<bos>Five murders so far.<eos>
<bos>And may kill again,<eol>which is whywe need your help.<eos>
<bos>Has anyone left recently?<eos>
<bos>(hand slapping table)<eos>
<bos>Yourworld does not interest us.<eos>
<bos>We have no need for<eol>yourviolence oryour questions.<eos>
<bos>I've said what is needed.<eos>
<bos>They have no right to be here<eol>at this time.<eos>
<bos>BrotherWilton, stand.<eos>
<bos>Before we can accept any man's person<eos>
<bos>we must accept our own.<eos>
<bos>And I askwho can stand in your sight<eos>
<bos>when onceyou are angry?<eos>
<bos>I am ashamed to lift up my face<eos>
<bos>and I shall not be ashamed<eol>in this evil time.<eos>
<bos>Make atonements for this wrath,<eol>BrotherWilton.<eos>
<bos>That's all right.<eos>
<bos>We didn't take any offense.<eos>
<bos>Anger, as violence, is not tolerated.<eos>
<bos>Our brother must be admonished.<eos>
<bos>(choking)<eos>
<bos>He can't breathe.<eos>
<bos>He does not need your help.<eos>
<bos>He's choking to death!<eos>
<bos>Remove BrotherAaron from the dining hall.<eos>
<bos>We did not inviteyou here to interfere.<eos>
<bos>We take care ofour own.<eos>
<bos>(rock music blaring)<eos>
<bos>Would you like to dance?<eos>
<bos>Not right now.<eos>
<bos>I'm really not interested, okay?<eos>
<bos>just one dance.<eos>
<bos>Yeah.<eos>
<bos>One dance.<eos>
<bos>It's a mile toyour car.<eos>
<bos>Stay on the path.<eos>
<bos>Thanks foryour cooperation.<eos>
<bos>Mulder: The Addams family finds religion.<eos>
<bos>Scully: Take me back to the 20th century.<eos>
<bos>You believe all that back there, Scully?<eos>
<bos>Believe all what?<eos>
<bos>All that "we take care<eol>ofour own" business?<eos>
<bos>They better, or that man at<eol>the dinner table is a dead man.<eos>
<bos>I think it was all an elaborate act.<eos>
<bos>What, the choking?<eos>
<bos>No. All this simple life crap.<eos>
<bos>These people know something.<eos>
<bos>You can see it in their eyes--<eos>
<bos>The way they look at one another.<eos>
<bos>Do they know who the murderer is?<eos>
<bos>They didn't answer a single question<eos>
<bos>and that outburst was right on cue.<eos>
<bos>Somehow we answered their questions.<eos>
<bos>Whyweren't there any children?<eos>
<bos>I know. That was odd.<eos>
<bos>You know what's really odd?<eos>
<bos>You know those pictures<eol>we saw in Steveston today<eos>
<bos>the ones from the '30s?<eos>
<bos>I saw some ofthose same faces<eol>at dinner tonight.<eos>
<bos>They've probably<eol>been intermarrying foryears.<eos>
<bos>Maybe.<eos>
<bos>Maybe not everything<eos>
<bos>is as black and white as it appears.<eos>
<bos>What areyou doing?<eos>
<bos>I'm going to go back<eol>for a little look-see.<eos>
<bos>Mulder: Maybe theywent to the movies.<eos>

<bos>What doyou think?<eos>
<bos>I think I want to see<eol>what's in that cellar.<eos>
<bos>Come with me.<eos>
<bos>I can giveyou information.<eos>
<bos>(chanting)<eos>
<bos>I know who did it.<eos>
<bos>The murders?<eos>
<bos>You've heard our prayers.<eos>
<bos>You've seen how we live our beliefs.<eos>
<bos>I wantyou to find this killer.<eos>
<bos>I wantyou to find him for me.<eos>
<bos>He was my best friend.<eos>
<bos>What's his name?<eos>
<bos>Brother Martin.<eos>
<bos>I called him Marty.<eos>
<bos>Martywas different.<eos>
<bos>What doyou mean, different?<eos>
<bos>How does he kill?<eos>
<bos>We're not sure.<eos>
<bos>All ofthe victims died ofcardiac arrest.<eos>
<bos>He poisons them, doesn't he?<eos>
<bos>Maybe. How doyou know that?<eos>
<bos>I need to showyou something.<eos>
<bos>Something about Marty.<eos>
<bos>We found them out on Route 44.<eol>We were wandering.<eos>
<bos>Marty and I used to do that.<eos>
<bos>Explore the edges ofourworld.<eos>
<bos>Somebody must have left them for garbage.<eos>
<bos>They are garbage.<eos>
<bos>Why did you keep them?<eos>
<bos>It was Martin who kept them.<eos>
<bos>Some ofwhat I saw in the magazines--<eos>
<bos>Some ofit was beautiful<eos>
<bos>but most ofit I didn't like.<eos>
<bos>It was garish, but Martin... Marty<eos>
<bos>he couldn't get enough.<eos>
<bos>He liked even the paper<eol>it was printed on. Slick.<eos>
<bos>Martywas captured byyourworld.<eos>
<bos>He left us to become one ofyou.<eos>

<bos>BrotherWilton.<eos>
<bos>- The woman has returned. - Where is she?<eos>
<bos>With Andrew in the main house.<eos>
<bos>The other one?<eos>
<bos>He's missing.<eos>
<bos>Come.<eos>
<bos>You said Martywas different.<eos>
<bos>Yes.<eos>
<bos>How?<eos>
<bos>How did he kill his victims?<eos>
<bos>I could be banished.<eos>
<bos>Does it have something to do<eol>with the ceremony in the barn tonight?<eos>
<bos>What areyou doing?<eos>
<bos>(whispering:) Scully.<eos>
<bos>Marty is different.<eos>
<bos>We're all different.<eos>
<bos>Oh.<eos>
<bos>No.<eos>
<bos>No.<eos>
<bos>Scully?<eos>
<bos>Get offofher!<eos>
<bos>I asked you not to interfere.<eos>
<bos>What wereyou doing back there?<eos>
<bos>I don't know.<eos>
<bos>- You don't know?! - No.<eos>
<bos>(retching)<eos>
<bos>Areyou all right?<eos>
<bos>(rock music playing)<eos>
<bos>I wasn't ignoring you.<eos>
<bos>No. Ofcourse I sawyou.<eos>
<bos>I just...<eos>
<bos>I didn't recognizeyou.<eos>
<bos>That's all.<eos>
<bos>Excuse me.<eos>
<bos>I'm having a conversation.<eos>
<bos>Sorry. No.<eos>
<bos>Uh-huh.<eos>
<bos>Thanks.<eos>
<bos>Howyou feeling?<eos>
<bos>Better.<eos>
<bos>A little embarrassed, actually.<eos>
<bos>Why? You don't remember any ofit.<eos>
<bos>It's like I don't remember...<eos>
<bos>Why didn'tyou get out before he..?<eos>
<bos>He told me he knew who the killerwas.<eos>
<bos>How did you know he wasn't the killer?<eos>
<bos>I believed him.<eos>
<bos>So what did you see down in the cellar?<eos>
<bos>just BrotherWhat's-his-name<eol>buried in some gopher hole<eos>
<bos>in the wall. Buried alive.<eos>
<bos>How doyou know he was alive?<eos>
<bos>I was in there with him<eos>
<bos>and his face was different.<eos>
<bos>Even his hairwas almost feminine.<eos>
<bos>Like he was going through<eol>some kind ofa transformation.<eos>
<bos>Changing sexes?<eos>
<bos>That would explain<eol>the hotel securityvideo.<eos>
<bos>Soyou're saying these people...<eos>
<bos>I know what I saw, Scully<eos>
<bos>and I sawyou about to do the wild thing<eos>
<bos>with some stranger.<eos>
<bos>Think he was trying to kill me?<eos>
<bos>(sighing)<eos>
<bos>Maybe it's the sex that kills.<eos>
<bos>Ifhe was trying to kill me,<eol>why did they let us go?<eos>
<bos>I don't know.<eos>
<bos>(laughing)<eos>
<bos>(knocking)<eos>
<bos>All right, let's break it up.<eos>
<bos>(groaning)<eos>
<bos>Out ofthe car.<eos>
<bos>Sorry, Officer.<eos>

<bos>(gasping, coughing)<eos>
<bos>On a scale ofone to ten,<eol>she was a... kind three.<eos>
<bos>But there was something about her.<eos>
<bos>Did she touch you<eos>
<bos>or make any other physical contact?<eos>
<bos>Her touch was... electric.<eos>
<bos>But after that I remember... onlyvaguely.<eos>
<bos>What doyou remember?<eos>
<bos>Nothing, actually.<eos>
<bos>Try to remember, Michael.<eos>
<bos>The policeman at the scene<eol>supports whatyou said.<eos>
<bos>But maybe there was something<eol>unusual about this woman...<eos>
<bos>something you wouldn't feel comfortable<eos>
<bos>telling the police on the record.<eos>
<bos>- This is offthe record? - Absolutely.<eos>
<bos>What did you see, Michael?<eos>
<bos>After she left the car...<eos>
<bos>and she was fighting with the cop<eos>
<bos>I saw her in her clothes<eol>and she looked like a...<eos>
<bos>(nervous laugh)<eos>
<bos>She looked like a man.<eos>
<bos>She was a man?<eos>
<bos>The club scene used to be so simple.<eos>
<bos>It's offthe record.<eos>
<bos>Scout's honor.<eos>
<bos>Scully: We can't rule out<eos>
<bos>that we're looking for a transvestite.<eos>
<bos>I think DonJuan there<eol>knows the difference<eos>
<bos>between males and females.<eos>
<bos>I don't want us to ignore the obvious.<eos>
<bos>How else could a woman<eol>overpower a 200-pound cop?<eos>
<bos>She was a he.<eos>
<bos>Woman: Agent Mulder. Agent Scully.<eos>
<bos>The credit card stolen<eol>from the last victim in D.C.<eos>
<bos>wasjust used to order take-out<eol>in a hotel eight blocks away.<eos>
<bos>Marty (Woman): It was always forbidden.<eos>
<bos>But after the first time,<eol>I couldn't help myself.<eos>
<bos>Touching a human man or a woman...<eos>
<bos>is as powerful for me as it was foryou.<eos>
<bos>This is Agent Scully<eol>requesting police backup<eos>
<bos>and additional agents<eos>
<bos>at 771 Catherine Street--<eol>the Hotel Catherine.<eos>
<bos>Yourworld offers pleasures...<eos>
<bos>pleasures we don't know<eol>because we're different.<eos>
<bos>Butyou know that now.<eos>
<bos>The others will punish me<eol>forwhat I've done.<eos>
<bos>They'll find me because the day is coming<eos>
<bos>and theywon't leave without me.<eos>

<bos>Stay down!<eos>
<bos>Dead body!<eos>

<bos>Scully?<eos>
<bos>Scully: I'm okay.<eos>
<bos>(breathing hard)<eos>
<bos>(whimpers)<eos>
<bos>Scully, down the stairs.<eos>
<bos>Federal agent! I'm armed!<eos>
<bos>Back away!<eos>
<bos>Step away!<eos>
<bos>Step away.<eos>
<bos>Please... don't hurt him.<eos>
<bos>No. Step away.<eos>
<bos>I'm armed.<eos>
<bos>Mulder: Scully!<eos>
<bos>The surrounding ten blocks<eos>
<bos>have been secured for the past hour.<eos>
<bos>We set up roadblocks<eos>
<bos>on all the routes out to Steveston.<eos>
<bos>No reports ofthem.<eos>
<bos>There's no way they could<eol>have gotten through.<eos>
<bos>What ifthey did get through?<eos>
<bos>There's only one place they'd hide.<eos>
<bos>They're gone.<eos>
<bos>We found something in the hay field.<eos>
<bos>Scully: I don't understand.<eos>
<bos>How can theyjust disappear?<eos>
<bos>They have no means oftransportation.<eos>
<bos>No earthly means oftransportation.<eos>
