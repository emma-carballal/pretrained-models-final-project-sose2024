<bos>Any other aircraft in the area?<eos>
<bos>No known aircraft can maneuver like this.<eos>
<bos>Well, whatever it was<eos>

<bos>Hit ground west of Lake Michigan<eos>
<bos>outside Townsend, Wisconsin.<eos>

<bos>calculated impact at over 800<eos>
<bos>miles per hour.<eos>
<bos>l've instructed Chief Koretz<eos>
<bos>to start her report...<eos>
<bos>Negative.<eos>
<bos>She tracked a meteor.<eos>
<bos>lt's aberrant movement<eos>
<bos>was due to instrument malfunction.<eos>
<bos>But, sir...<eos>

<bos>until the government<eol>investigation now underway<eos>
<bos>is completed.<eos>
<bos>Government officials remain vague<eos>
<bos>about the toxic cargo that has<eol>caused the immediate evacuation<eos>
<bos>ofTownsend, Wisconsin's,<eol>1 2,000 residents.<eos>
<bos>Speculation here has centered on<eos>
<bos>a shipment oftoxic waste.<eos>
<bos>by an electronic fence<eol>that reaches 1 5,000 miles<eos>
<bos>into space.<eos>
<bos>We use it to track and monitor<eos>
<bos>the 7,087 man-made objects<eol>that orbit the earth.<eos>
<bos>Last night at 231 7<eol>that fence was breached.<eos>
<bos>This morning at 01 00<eos>
<bos>Operation Falcon went into effect<eos>
<bos>led by Colonel Calvin Henderson<eos>
<bos>the Air Force's reclamations expert.<eos>
<bos>Reclamations?<eos>
<bos>During the Cold War, hisjob<eos>
<bos>was to prevent technologies<eol>from downed U.S. aircraft<eos>
<bos>from getting into Soviet hands.<eos>
<bos>He's part ofa crash retrieval unit.<eos>
<bos>Mm-hmm.<eos>
<bos>Quick response.<eos>
<bos>l'd sayyou have 24 hours<eos>
<bos>before the entire area is sanitized.<eos>
<bos>After that, it would be<eol>like nothing ever happened.<eos>
<bos>Man: Alright, get the trucks rolling.<eos>
<bos>Man: Keep 'emgoing!<eos>

<bos>Youjust made the worst mistake<eos>
<bos>ofyour life, Agent Mulder.<eos>
<bos>l thinkyou knocked out a filling.<eos>
<bos>You'll pay the price<eos>
<bos>for putting my men at risk.<eos>
<bos>Since when does taking pictures<eol>put lives at risk?<eos>
<bos>You violated a U.S. Government quarantine<eos>
<bos>and that's a federal crime.<eos>
<bos>A quarantine?<eos>
<bos>That's whatyou call this?<eos>
<bos>We're trying to contain<eol>an ecological disaster.<eos>
<bos>That's a lot offirepower<eol>to protect Mother Nature.<eos>
<bos>l have my orders<eos>
<bos>and the license to execute them<eol>as l see fit.<eos>
<bos>l suggest you forget whatyou saw<eos>
<bos>orwhatyou thinkyou saw<eos>
<bos>foryour own well-being.<eos>
<bos>You've got a downed craft<eol>in those woods, sir<eos>
<bos>and troops carrying live rounds.<eos>
<bos>We both know what's out there!<eos>
<bos>Areyou MUFON or KUFOS?<eos>

<bos>Can l askyou a question?<eos>
<bos>Go ahead.<eos>
<bos>Did you see anything?<eos>
<bos>Did you get close?<eos>
<bos>Me, l saw nothing.<eos>
<bos>l didn't see anything!<eos>
<bos>Nada, zip.<eos>
<bos>A hundred yards past the roadblock<eos>
<bos>they nailed me.<eos>
<bos>l have no idea how they did it.<eos>
<bos>l'm telling you<eos>
<bos>it's like the Roswell cover-up<eol>all over again.<eos>
<bos>What makes you so sure<eol>there's something out there?<eos>
<bos>Same thing that makes you so sure?<eos>
<bos>l didn't order room service.<eos>
<bos>This isn't funny, Mulder.<eos>
<bos>Did you meet Max?<eos>
<bos>Who?<eos>
<bos>Max from NlCAP.<eos>
<bos>Oh. They must have released him.<eos>
<bos>Another intrepid soul<eol>in search ofa close encounter.<eos>
<bos>ls that what this is about?<eos>
<bos>What else?<eos>
<bos>Try explaining that<eol>to Section Chief McGrath.<eos>
<bos>He's ordering a full inquiry<eos>
<bos>with a recommendation...<eos>
<bos>Mulder, he wants to shut down the X-Files<eos>
<bos>and he wants you out ofthe Bureau.<eos>
<bos>What else is new?<eos>
<bos>l don't understand you, Mulder--<eos>
<bos>whyyou're always defying protocol<eos>
<bos>ignoringjurisdiction.<eos>
<bos>Because l know what l saw, Scully.<eos>
<bos>There weren't train tracks<eol>anywhere near that site.<eos>
<bos>So how could it have been<eol>a derailed container?<eos>
<bos>Because it wasn't.<eos>
<bos>Whatyou saw was not a toxic spill.<eos>
<bos>But it wasn't a U.F.O., either.<eos>
<bos>Okay, l'm all ears. what was it?<eos>
<bos>lt was a downed Libyanjet<eol>with a nuclearwarhead.<eos>
<bos>(chuckling)<eos>
<bos>Over U.S. airspace?<eos>
<bos>They've been picking up radiation<eos>
<bos>indicating that the plutonium casing<eos>
<bos>may have cracked.<eos>
<bos>So to avoid mass panic...<eos>
<bos>You really believe that story?<eos>
<bos>That story happens to be<eol>highly classified.<eos>
<bos>A highly classified lie.<eos>
<bos>(helicopterwhirring)<eos>
<bos>They're searching for someone, Scully.<eos>
<bos>Probably the pilot.<eos>
<bos>You think they'd roll out<eol>all this material<eos>
<bos>for one Libyan fighterjock?<eos>
<bos>Besides, no human pilot<eol>walked away from that wreckage.<eos>
<bos>Well, maybe he ejected.<eos>
<bos>Maybe.<eos>
<bos>Scully: You can't be serious.<eos>
<bos>As long as we're here<eol>in Townsend, why not?<eos>
<bos>The hearing is tomorrow morning.<eos>
<bos>That gives us 24 hours to investigate.<eos>
<bos>My assignment is to bring you back--<eos>
<bos>not to helpyou dig yourselfin deeper.<eos>

<bos>Following my career? How?<eos>

<bos>l published that under a pseudonym.<eos>
<bos>M.F. Luder. l know.<eos>
<bos>lt's an anagram for F. Mulder.<eos>
<bos>You really didn't think<eol>that would fool us, did you?<eos>
<bos>l didn't think anybody<eol>was paying attention.<eos>
<bos>Somebody is always<eol>paying attention, Mr. Mulder.<eos>
<bos>Amazing.<eos>
<bos>Amazing? Hardly.<eos>
<bos>You want to see something amazing<eos>

<bos>Theywere right here.<eos>
<bos>Oh, here they are.<eos>
<bos>The latest crop circle photos<eol>from Project Argus. Huh?<eos>
<bos>Your opinion-- fact or fraud?<eos>
<bos>Mulder: Fraud.<eos>
<bos>or a systematic reaction<eol>by the plant tissue<eos>
<bos>to being lodged in one position.<eos>
<bos>Max: You've read the literature.<eos>
<bos>Mulder: l try to keep up.<eos>
<bos>You said you had something to show us.<eos>
<bos>Oh, yeah. The Wolfs Ear 2000.<eos>

<bos>You're breaking up. Barely... bad...<eos>
<bos>Very bad. Wait a second.<eos>
<bos>What the hell?<eos>
<bos>Charlie, we got a situation here.<eos>
<bos>We put up a tight net.<eos>
<bos>Yes, sir, every inch<eol>ofground is being covered<eos>
<bos>dug up, squeezed, and sifted.<eos>

<bos>He's dead.<eos>
<bos>What else is there to know?<eos>
<bos>l'm sorry aboutyour husband.<eos>
<bos>Oh, please.<eos>
<bos>Mrs. Wright, we want to helpyou.<eos>
<bos>Then leave me alone.<eos>
<bos>Let us helpyou.<eos>
<bos>l don't know anything.<eos>
<bos>Don'tyou understand?<eos>
<bos>Theywon't even release the body<eos>
<bos>so l can give him a proper burial, okay?<eos>
<bos>The government can't do that.<eos>
<bos>l'm sure ifwe appealed...<eos>
<bos>No! You can't.<eos>
<bos>You're entitled to the truth.<eos>
<bos>l can't afford the truth.<eos>
<bos>They said ifl spoke to anyone<eos>
<bos>theywould withhold my husband's pension<eos>
<bos>and l have a child to take care of.<eos>

<bos>jackson?<eos>
<bos>Nothing.<eos>
<bos>Must have been an animal.<eos>
<bos>l'm sorry, but unless you have a subpoena<eos>
<bos>l can't discuss patient information.<eos>
<bos>Does that meanJason Wright<eol>was your patient?<eos>
<bos>lt means l have nothing more to say.<eos>
<bos>What about to his wife and child, Doctor?<eos>
<bos>Would you have anything to say to them?<eos>
<bos>Because whoever got toyou<eol>also got to her.<eos>
<bos>They must have made<eol>some pretty big threats.<eos>
<bos>What did they hold overyour head--<eos>
<bos>your medical license, the l.R.S.?<eos>
<bos>l hate fascists.<eos>
<bos>Excuse me?<eos>
<bos>The men who came in here--<eos>
<bos>The way they pushed us all around.<eos>
<bos>Dr. Oppenheim, tell us about the deputy.<eos>
<bos>You saw him that night<eos>
<bos>didn'tyou?<eos>
<bos>Yes.<eos>
<bos>And three others from a fire crew.<eos>
<bos>Theywere all D.O.A. with<eol>fifth- and sixth-degree burns<eos>
<bos>over 90% oftheir bodies.<eos>
<bos>But theyweren't like<eol>any burns l've ever seen.<eos>
<bos>They took the bodies away<eos>
<bos>before we could perform any pathology.<eos>
<bos>Did you note any cadaveric<eol>heat rigor or stiffening?<eos>
<bos>Quite a bit offexion in the limbs.<eos>
<bos>How doyou know so much about it?<eos>
<bos>l did my residency in forensic medicine.<eos>
<bos>ln your opinion<eos>
<bos>could those burns have been<eol>caused by ionizing radiation?<eos>
<bos>Well, l hadn't thought.<eos>
<bos>l suppose it's possible<eos>
<bos>ifthe exposure was sufficiently intense.<eos>
<bos>Let's say those men died<eol>from radiation exposure.<eos>
<bos>Couldn't it have been<eol>from the cracked core<eos>
<bos>ofa nuclearwarhead?<eos>
<bos>l've read about these kinds ofburns.<eos>
<bos>So have l-- in Hiroshima at ground zero.<eos>
<bos>l'm talking about<eol>close encounter mortalities.<eos>
<bos>l have a stack ofX-Files<eol>reporting the same results.<eos>
<bos>l don't claim to know all the answers<eos>
<bos>but ifwe don't make the O.P.R. inquest<eos>
<bos>by tomorrow morning<eos>
<bos>there may not be any more X-Files.<eos>

<bos>Start an l.V. here, stat.<eos>
<bos>Mulder: Tell us what happened.<eos>
<bos>Whatever happened<eol>has nothing to do with you.<eos>
<bos>Wrong, Colonel.<eos>
<bos>We want the same thing,<eol>onlyyou want it dead.<eos>
<bos>Can'tyou see that chasing it down<eos>
<bos>leaves it no choice but to defend itself?<eos>
<bos>How many more have to die before<eol>you rethinkyour approach?<eos>
<bos>Listen to me<eos>
<bos>'cause l'm not wasting<eol>another breath on this.<eos>
<bos>lfyou and your partner<eos>
<bos>aren't out ofhere in 30 seconds...<eos>
<bos>Agent Scully stays here.<eos>

<bos>lfthat's okay.<eos>
<bos>Ofcourse.<eos>

<bos>and let me do mywork.<eos>
<bos>Outside this emergency room<eol>you can do whateveryou want<eos>
<bos>but in here l call the shots--<eos>
<bos>assuming, ofcourse<eos>

<bos>Get this man<eos>

<bos>Max, it's me, Fox Mulder.<eos>
<bos>You okay?<eos>
<bos>What areyou doing here?<eos>
<bos>You were having some kind ofseizure.<eos>
<bos>Seizure?<eos>
<bos>That's impossible.<eos>
<bos>You were lying on the foor<eol>unconscious, convulsing.<eos>
<bos>That's odd.<eos>
<bos>l haven't had an episode in seven years--<eos>
<bos>not since l went on medication.<eos>
<bos>Let's getyou to the hospital.<eos>
<bos>No.<eos>
<bos>l mean, l mean it's not necessary.<eos>
<bos>You sure?<eos>
<bos>Yeah. l lived with epilepsy all my life.<eos>
<bos>l'm not in any danger.<eos>
<bos>Yeah, it started in South Dakota<eos>
<bos>when l was ten.<eos>
<bos>The doctor said l must<eol>have incurred a head injury.<eos>
<bos>l don't remember ever hitting my head.<eos>
<bos>You have no memory ofyour seizures?<eos>
<bos>As a kid l used to wake up<eol>in strange places<eos>
<bos>with no idea where l was<eol>or how l got there.<eos>
<bos>(sighs)<eos>
<bos>Sorry. l...<eos>
<bos>l got to, l got to go to sleep.<eos>
<bos>All right.<eos>
<bos>(sighing)<eos>
<bos>Rough night, huh?<eos>
<bos>lt was terrible.<eos>
<bos>We lost all but two<eos>
<bos>and they're still in critical condition<eos>
<bos>on theirway to the burn unit<eos>
<bos>atJohns Hopkins.<eos>
<bos>So what doyou think, Scully?<eos>
<bos>What's going on out there?<eos>
<bos>l don't know, and under<eol>other circumstances<eos>
<bos>l would like to find out<eos>
<bos>but we have a plane to catch<eol>injust over an hour.<eos>
<bos>l wantyou to take<eol>a look at something first.<eos>
<bos>What?<eos>
<bos>Max.<eos>
<bos>There's an unusual incision<eol>behind his left ear.<eos>
<bos>l've seen this incision twice before.<eos>
<bos>Two women-- a thousand miles apart<eos>
<bos>no way ofknowing each other, no relation.<eos>
<bos>both claim to have been<eol>abducted by aliens.<eos>
<bos>areyou saying Max Fenig is an abductee?<eos>
<bos>Mulder<eos>
<bos>the man is taking<eol>powerful antipsychotic drugs.<eos>
<bos>l saw them in his R.V.<eos>
<bos>They're for his epilepsy.<eos>
<bos>Dilantin is an anti-convulsant<eos>
<bos>but Mellaril is used exclusively<eol>to treat schizophrenia.<eos>
<bos>More than likely, Max is delusional.<eos>
<bos>You don't seem to understand, Scully.<eos>
<bos>Max doesn't believe<eol>he was abducted by aliens.<eos>
<bos>l believe he was.<eos>
<bos>Now, could you at least<eol>take a look at the scar<eos>
<bos>and give meyour medical opinion?<eos>
<bos>Okay.<eos>
<bos>You pack.<eos>
<bos>l'll take a look at Max<eol>on the way to the airport.<eos>
<bos>Sir, l have fash traffic at 24-1 8.<eos>
<bos>Repeated calls for l.D. go unanswered<eos>
<bos>and it's not in the orbital<eol>or sub-orbital inventory.<eos>
<bos>24-1 8-- isn't that where..?<eos>
<bos>Same exact spot, sir<eos>
<bos>though l am reading a much larger craft.<eos>
<bos>Meteor, Ms. Koretz.<eos>
<bos>A much larger meteor, sir.<eos>
<bos>Hold on a second.<eos>
<bos>We have a confirm.<eos>
<bos>Whitmarsh Air Force Base is tracking.<eos>
<bos>Where is it?<eos>
<bos>Well, sir, the meteor<eol>seems to be hovering<eos>
<bos>over a small town in eastern Wisconsin.<eos>

<bos>Mulder!<eos>
<bos>Come on.<eos>
<bos>Where doyou think you're going?<eos>
<bos>lfwe go to the airport now,<eol>we might make the plane<eos>
<bos>which would giveyou halfa chance<eos>
<bos>ofdefending yourself.<eos>
<bos>Think about it.<eos>
<bos>Max is a gypsy, nomad, right?<eos>
<bos>Yes. So what?<eos>
<bos>He intercepted Wright's last call<eos>
<bos>to his dispatcher<eos>
<bos>which means he was here<eol>in Townsend, Wisconsin<eos>
<bos>the night ofthe crash.<eos>
<bos>Ofall the places he could<eol>have been, he was here.<eos>
<bos>lf Max was abducted<eos>
<bos>that would go a long way<eos>
<bos>to explaining his obsessions.<eos>
<bos>lfwe figure that out, you<eol>can be sure Henderson has.<eos>
<bos>Doyou have the keys?<eos>
<bos>(panting)<eos>
<bos>Don't do this.<eos>
<bos>Sir, we've apprehended<eol>the target, a civilian.<eos>
<bos>Negative, Falcon patrol.<eos>
<bos>Take him with extreme caution.<eos>
<bos>They're dead.<eos>

<bos>What areyou doing?<eos>
<bos>You have a very sick man in there.<eos>
<bos>We're not in the hospital now,<eol>Dr. Scully.<eos>

<bos>Keep her clear.<eos>
<bos>Sir, this is Alpha team leader.<eos>

<bos>Sir, this is Alpha team leader.<eos>
<bos>Except for our men<eos>
<bos>l'm only picking up one figure inside.<eos>
<bos>l do not copy that.<eos>
<bos>We indicate only one figure<eos>
<bos>inside the building.<eos>
<bos>What?<eos>
<bos>Soldier: Blow the door!<eos>
<bos>Take him!<eos>
<bos>(soldiers chattering)<eos>
<bos>That's your unit, sir.<eos>
<bos>Where is he?<eos>
<bos>He's gone. They got to him first.<eos>
<bos>They beat us, Colonel.<eos>
<bos>Arrest him.<eos>
<bos>And keep looking.<eos>
<bos>Agent Scully<eos>
<bos>to the best ofyour knowledge,<eol>was Agent Mulder ever assigned<eos>
<bos>to investigate matters<eol>related to the evacuation<eos>
<bos>ofTownsend, Wisconsin?<eos>
<bos>No, sir.<eos>
<bos>At any time<eos>
<bos>wereyou aware ofhis submitting a Form 302<eos>
<bos>requesting said assignment<eol>or travel expenses?<eos>
<bos>No, sir.<eos>
<bos>While in Wisconsin<eos>
<bos>did Agent Mulder drive a blue Ford Taurus<eos>
<bos>registered to<eol>the State Car rental agency?<eos>
<bos>Yes, sir.<eos>
<bos>Thankyou, Agent Scully.<eos>
<bos>Sir, request permission<eol>to make a statement.<eos>
<bos>Request denied.<eos>
<bos>Sir, it's unfair tojudge Mulder<eol>by the same criteria...<eos>
<bos>You're dismissed.<eos>
<bos>But, sir...<eos>
<bos>That will be all.<eos>
<bos>You hear that noise, Scully?<eos>
<bos>Hammer and nails.<eos>
<bos>They're building a gallows<eol>in the town square.<eos>
<bos>Don't worry.<eos>
<bos>lt was only a matter oftime.<eos>
<bos>l'm surprised l lasted this long.<eos>
<bos>Good luck.<eos>
<bos>l'll break a leg.<eos>
<bos>McGrath: ...as well as<eol>insubordination and misconduct.<eos>
<bos>How doyou respond to<eol>these allegations, Agent Mulder?<eos>
<bos>Over a dozen men lost their lives<eos>
<bos>and you want me to respond<eol>to issues ofprotocol?<eos>
<bos>You failed to obtain proper<eol>authorization foryour actions.<eos>
<bos>l knew it wouldn't be forthcoming.<eos>
<bos>You also violated a Federal quarant...<eos>
<bos>A cover-up was underway...<eos>
<bos>Exposing yourself and possibly others<eos>
<bos>to toxic contamination!<eos>
<bos>Oh, toxic contamination.<eol>Are we back in that?<eos>
<bos>You read my report.<eos>
<bos>Explain Max Fenig's disappearance.<eos>
<bos>Your report is not the subject<eol>ofthis inquiry.<eos>
<bos>X rays taken while Mr. Fenig<eol>was institutionalized<eos>
<bos>showed an object<eol>lodged in his cerebellum.<eos>
<bos>That is irrelevant, Agent Mulder.<eos>
<bos>The man was abducted.<eos>
<bos>Everybody in this room knows it.<eos>
<bos>Colonel Henderson's<eol>written testimony states<eos>
<bos>that Fenig's body<eol>was found two hours later<eos>
<bos>in a cargo container.<eos>
<bos>Then what can l say?<eos>
<bos>How can l disprove lies that are stamped<eos>
<bos>with an official seal?<eos>
<bos>That will be all, Mr. Mulder.<eos>
<bos>(sighing)<eos>
<bos>You can deny all the things l've seen<eos>
<bos>all the things l've discovered,<eol>but not for much longer<eos>
<bos>'cause too many know<eol>what's happening out there<eos>
<bos>and no one, no government agency<eos>
<bos>hasjurisdiction over the truth.<eos>
<bos>Why did you countermand our decision?<eos>
<bos>Mulder's conduct was in clearviolation<eos>
<bos>not only of Bureau procedures,<eol>but of Federal Law.<eos>
<bos>Yes.<eos>
<bos>l don't understand.<eos>
<bos>The committee's case was airtight.<eos>
<bos>You've ruined the last best chance we had<eos>
<bos>to get rid ofhim.<eos>
<bos>l appreciate your frustration<eos>
<bos>butyou and l both know<eol>that Mulder's work--<eos>
<bos>his, uh... singular passion--<eos>
<bos>poses a most unique dilemma<eos>
<bos>but his occasional insubordination<eos>
<bos>is in the end far less dangerous.<eos>
<bos>With respect, sir--<eos>
<bos>less dangerous than what?<eos>
<bos>Than having him exposed<eol>to the wrong people--<eos>
<bos>what he knows...<eos>
<bos>what he thinks he knows.<eos>
<bos>(sighing)<eos>
<bos>Always keepyour friends<eol>close, Mr. McGrath<eos>
<bos>but keepyour enemies closer.<eos>
