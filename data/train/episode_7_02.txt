<bos>Unit Four, I got a fire<eol>out on the highway at the 20-mile mark.<eos>
<bos>Unit Four, confirmation<eol>of downed aircraft burning.<eos>
<bos>All units, we've got a 10-13.<eos>
<bos>Unit Four, this is Detective Miles.<eos>
<bos>I'm coming right at you, Ray.<eos>
<bos>Now, you wait for backup<eol>before you head out, all right?<eos>
<bos>Unit Four, come back, Deputy.<eos>
<bos>Deputy Hoese.<eos>
<bos>- Ray?<eos>
<bos>Oh, my God.<eos>
<bos>Lariat car rentals totals...<eos>
<bos>Would you like to see the figure?<eos>
<bos>- Is that a lot? - A lot?<eos>
<bos>Gas, expenses, the motel rooms alone...<eos>
<bos>By F.B.I. standards,<eol>these numbers are out of control.<eos>
<bos>We could start sharing rooms.<eos>
<bos>You're under evaluation.<eol>There has to be a point when we say no.<eos>
<bos>You can't really compare what we do<eol>to other departments in the bureau.<eos>
<bos>- Right. This business with aliens.<eol>- There's more to it than that.<eos>
<bos>But at the end of the day,<eol>you'd say aliens are your real focus?<eos>
<bos>That's the reason I got started, yeah.<eos>
<bos>Investigating your sister's abduction...<eos>
<bos>and the government conspiracy around it.<eos>
<bos>Both of which have<eol>been resolved, correct?<eos>
<bos>Nothing has been resolved, exactly.<eos>
<bos>In this case report here,<eol>it's concluded your sister is dead,<eos>
<bos>as well as the men who took her.<eos>
<bos>This is your handwriting<eol>here on the report, Agent Mulder?<eos>
<bos>Yeah.<eos>
<bos>So, what exactly is left to investigate?<eos>
<bos>Your release has been arranged.<eos>
<bos>Marita Covarrubias.<eos>
<bos>Last time I saw you, I left you for dead.<eos>
<bos>Alex, if it was strictly up to me,<eos>
<bos>I'd leave you here to rot too.<eos>
<bos>I see the money bleed out,<eos>
<bos>but it just doesn't seem to make<eol>the results of your work any better.<eos>
<bos>So many of the cases you investigate<eol>are left unexplained.<eos>
<bos>Makes it hard to justify the expense.<eos>
<bos>So much of the work that we do<eol>cannot be measured in standard terms.<eos>
<bos>- How would you measure it?<eol>- We open doors...<eos>
<bos>with the X-Files<eol>which lead to other doors.<eos>
<bos>Doors leading to...<eos>
<bos>a conspiracy of men who<eol>cooperated with alien beings...<eos>
<bos>"to create human/alien hybrids...<eos>
<bos>so we could all become slaves<eol>of an alien invasion."<eos>
<bos>I believe that<eol>there was once a conspiracy.<eos>
<bos>I believe I was taken by men...<eos>
<bos>who subjected me to medical tests...<eos>
<bos>which gave me cancer and left me barren.<eos>
<bos>But you don't believe in aliens?<eos>
<bos>I've seen things that I cannot deny.<eos>
<bos>Who sent you?<eos>
<bos>- The Smoking Man.<eos>
<bos>He's dying.<eos>
<bos>You said you were finished.<eos>
<bos>I turned in my report and was asked<eol>to go over a few things.<eos>
<bos>As you know, the times we live in,<eol>the world is changing fast.<eos>
<bos>I'm missing your point.<eos>
<bos>As I said, this is an evaluation,<eol>Agent Mulder, to understand what you do,<eos>
<bos>so if you go forward,<eol>you can do so more responsibly.<eos>
<bos>That sounds more like a threat.<eos>
<bos>Cost benefit analysis.<eos>
<bos>But if you want the truth, I really<eol>don't care one way or the other.<eos>
<bos>You mostly record bizarre facts<eol>on bizarre cases.<eos>
<bos>In other words, information gathering.<eos>
<bos>Something, it seems to me,<eol>you can easily do on the Internet.<eos>
<bos>I can't do my job from an office.<eol>I promise you.<eos>
<bos>Nowadays, the most advanced<eol>space exploration...<eos>
<bos>is done sitting in an office,<eol>Agent Mulder.<eos>
<bos>Why? It's just too damn expensive<eol>putting men in outer space.<eos>
<bos>- I'm not looking in outer space.<eol>- Bringing us to the point.<eos>
<bos>If you spend so much time<eol>and money looking for aliens,<eos>
<bos>responsibly you should<eol>narrow your search.<eos>
<bos>- To where? - Wherever they are.<eos>
<bos>It's not unreasonable.<eos>
<bos>It's just a matter<eol>of reducing your vision.<eos>
<bos>Hey, you all right?<eos>
<bos>What's the problem?<eos>
<bos>- Isn't that your car, Mr. Miles? - Yeah.<eos>
<bos>A small accident.<eos>
<bos>Everything's all right.<eol>What are you boys doing out here?<eos>
<bos>Well, we heard there was a plane crash.<eos>
<bos>Military jet fighter<eol>collided midair with a U.F.O.<eos>
<bos>Navy found their plane<eol>about three miles away.<eos>
<bos>We've seen no evidence<eol>of any other crash.<eos>
<bos>But we heard a sheriff say<eol>he saw a fire burning...<eos>
<bos>off the highway at the 20-mile mark.<eos>
<bos>There's nothing out here.<eol>No fire. No sign of fire.<eos>
<bos>Now, you boys go on home.<eos>
<bos>There's nothing to see here.<eos>
<bos>I think I'm in big trouble.<eos>
<bos>How many times have they tried<eol>to shut us down?<eos>
<bos>Yeah, but I never actually<eol>assaulted an auditor before.<eos>
<bos>- Did you hurt him?<eol>- I reduced his vision a little bit.<eos>
<bos>- Mulder.<eos>
<bos>-  Agent Fox Mulder? - Speaking.<eos>
<bos>My name is Billy Miles.<eol>I don't know if you remember me.<eos>
<bos>Yeah, Oregon, seven years ago.<eos>
<bos>You had multiple abduction experiences.<eol>I'm here with Agent Scully.<eos>
<bos>- Billy, are you all right? - Yeah.<eos>
<bos>This may seem weird,<eol>me calling like this,<eos>
<bos>but, uh, I don't know where else to turn.<eos>
<bos>- Is it happening again, Billy?<eos>
<bos>Yeah, but not to me this time.<eos>
<bos>More alien abductions, Scully.<eos>
<bos>Mmm.<eos>
<bos>I don't know how we could<eol>possibly justify the expense.<eos>
<bos>We'd probably turn up nothing.<eos>
<bos>Let's go waste some money.<eos>
<bos>Hi. He's anxious to see you.<eos>
<bos>- I was worried about you, Alex.<eol>- Cut the crap, old man.<eos>
<bos>I heard about your incarceration.<eos>
<bos>You had me thrown in that hellhole.<eos>
<bos>For trying to sell something<eol>that was mine, was it not?<eos>
<bos>I hope we can all move forward,<eos>
<bos>put the past behind us.<eos>
<bos>We have a singular opportunity now.<eos>
<bos>- "Singular opportunity"?<eol>- There's been a crash in Oregon.<eos>
<bos>An alien ship has collided<eol>with a military aircraft.<eos>
<bos>Recovery is all important.<eos>
<bos>It's Roswell and Corona all over again...<eos>
<bos>50 years later.<eos>
<bos>It's our chance to rebuild the project.<eos>
<bos>How do you know someone<eol>hasn't already recovered it?<eos>
<bos>It's never quite so easy.<eos>
<bos>- I'm getting something here, Gary.<eol>- I told you, Richie.<eos>
<bos>Hey, man, look at this.<eos>
<bos>Gary!<eos>
<bos>Gary?<eos>
<bos>Come on, man.<eos>
<bos>My dad got them to fudge<eol>the psych qualifications.<eos>
<bos>- You're married, Billy. - Uh, divorced.<eos>
<bos>I live back with my dad now.<eos>
<bos>You've never, um...<eos>
<bos>Have you ever been able<eol>to get over the abductions?<eos>
<bos>Well, I have, but people haven't.<eol>No one really believes it.<eos>
<bos>My dad still denies it ever happened...<eol>that any one of us was taken.<eos>
<bos>Does he deny that it's happening now?<eos>
<bos>There was a crash.<eos>
<bos>A navy pilot hit an unidentified<eol>aircraft outside of town.<eos>
<bos>Now, the military found their jet,<eos>
<bos>but the other craft<eol>hasn't been recovered.<eos>
<bos>- Why not? - Well, it's our county,<eos>
<bos>and we're in charge<eol>of coordinating efforts.<eos>
<bos>But my dad has really been no help,<eol>even though we have a deputy missing.<eos>
<bos>You find the U.F.O.,<eol>and he won't be able to deny the truth.<eos>
<bos>I hope that's all it is.<eos>
<bos>What's going on, Bill?<eos>
<bos>Just talking to some people<eol>you might remember, Dad, from the F.B.I.<eos>
<bos>- Agent Scully, Agent Mulder. - Oh.<eos>
<bos>What brings you folks out here?<eos>
<bos>You're not thinking this incident's<eol>some kind of U.F.O.?<eos>
<bos>The crash of an unidentified craft.<eos>
<bos>Well, I've been on with the F.A.A.<eol>You might want to follow up.<eos>
<bos>Looks an awful lot<eol>like there was no crash at all.<eos>
<bos>Deja vu all over again.<eos>
<bos>That was there already, in case<eol>you're wondering at all about it.<eos>
<bos>I watched Agent Mulder<eol>paint that there seven years ago.<eos>
<bos>the kind where time<eol>gets bent or goes missing...<eos>
<bos>or where your car loses power<eol>and dies in the middle of the road.<eos>
<bos>These skid marks are mine.<eos>
<bos>That was the deputy's car up there<eol>sitting there without his lights on?<eos>
<bos>If they'd been on, I would have seen him.<eos>
<bos>Good point.<eos>
<bos>Detective?<eos>
<bos>Did the, uh, deputy carry a.38?<eos>
<bos>.38 super. Why?<eos>
<bos>Three shells were discharged.<eos>
<bos>I imagine they could've<eol>rolled from up there.<eos>
<bos>- What was he shooting at?<eol>- Probably nothing.<eos>
<bos>Was the missing deputy a good cop?<eos>
<bos>Yeah, sure, I guess.<eos>
<bos>Married? Single?<eos>
<bos>Bill!<eos>
<bos>- Come on over here with those.<eol>- He was married. New baby.<eos>
<bos>You know, they only want to solve this.<eos>
<bos>Get in the car, Bill.<eos>
<bos>- Yes? - Sorry to bother you, Mrs. Hoese.<eos>
<bos>- We're with the F.B.I.<eol>- Is this about my husband?<eos>
<bos>Are... You're Teresa? Teresa Nemman?<eos>
<bos>Yes.<eos>
<bos>Seven years ago you came to<eol>Agent Scully and I for help.<eos>
<bos>- You were afraid of being abducted.<eol>- Oh, my God.<eos>
<bos>- Uh...<eos>
<bos>Please come in.<eos>
<bos>I'm sorry.<eos>
<bos>I sort of lost it<eol>when I realized who you were.<eos>
<bos>We, uh, came to see if there's<eol>anything that you can tell us...<eos>
<bos>that might help us find your husband.<eos>
<bos>We had no idea you were his wife.<eos>
<bos>I don't know if it's important.<eos>
<bos>Maybe I just hope it's not, but...<eos>
<bos>Ray and I have a connection...<eos>
<bos>that's even deeper for us.<eos>
<bos>He's an abductee too?<eos>
<bos>He kept it a secret from almost everyone.<eos>
<bos>It doesn't make you<eol>real popular around here.<eos>
<bos>His experiences were<eol>a lot more terrifying than mine.<eos>
<bos>He was taken many times and tested.<eos>
<bos>I have extensive<eol>medical records on him...<eos>
<bos>and photos of his scars.<eos>
<bos>- I'll get you the files.<eol>Can you hold him?<eos>
<bos>It's okay. Thank you.<eos>
<bos>What do you see? What do you see?<eos>
<bos>What's that?<eos>
<bos>- Once upon a time<eol>there was a little baby<eos>
<bos>- Who is it?<eos>
<bos>It's me.<eos>
<bos>- What's wrong, Scully? You look sick.<eol>- I don't know what's wrong.<eos>
<bos>Come in.<eos>
<bos>I, um...<eos>
<bos>I was starting to get ready for bed,<eol>and I started to feel really dizzy.<eos>
<bos>Vertigo or something. And then<eol>I just... I started to get chills.<eos>
<bos>You want me to call a doctor?<eos>
<bos>No, I just...<eos>
<bos>I just want to get warm.<eos>
<bos>Oh, good.<eos>
<bos>Thank you.<eos>
<bos>It's not worth it, Scully.<eos>
<bos>What?<eos>
<bos>- I want you to go home.<eol>- Mulder, I'm gonna be fine.<eos>
<bos>No, no, I've been thinking about it.<eos>
<bos>Looking at you today<eol>holding that baby and...<eos>
<bos>knowing everything's<eol>that been taken away from you...<eos>
<bos>a chance for motherhood<eol>and your health...<eos>
<bos>and that made me...<eos>
<bos>think that... maybe they're right.<eos>
<bos>Who's right?<eos>
<bos>The F.B.I.<eos>
<bos>Maybe what they say is true,<eol>but for all the wrong reasons.<eos>
<bos>It's the personal costs<eol>that are too high.<eos>
<bos>There's so much more<eol>you need to do with your life.<eos>
<bos>There's so much more than this.<eos>
<bos>There has to be an end, Scully.<eos>
<bos>Of course they can't.<eos>
<bos>You know why? 'Cause it's not here.<eos>
<bos>It's there, Alex.<eos>
<bos>I'm certain of it.<eos>
<bos>Hidden in plain sight.<eos>
<bos>You listen to me.<eos>
<bos>If you're gonna play games, Mulder<eol>and Scully, they're gonna beat me to it.<eos>
<bos>Are you saying that Mulder and Scully<eol>are there looking for the U.F.O.?<eos>
<bos>They're looking for a missing deputy.<eos>
<bos>Well, they're looking for<eol>the right thing, but in the wrong place.<eos>
<bos>You sent me looking for a ship.<eos>
<bos>Find the deputy, find the ship.<eos>
<bos>Who is it?<eos>
<bos>Ray?<eos>
<bos>Oh, my God. Oh, my God.<eos>
<bos>I was so worried.<eos>
<bos>I-I was so sure...<eos>
<bos>What did they do to you this time?<eos>
<bos>Ray, talk to me.<eos>
<bos>You're not my husband.<eos>
<bos>No! No!<eos>
<bos>What happened, Billy?<eos>
<bos>Teresa's gone.<eol>She's been taken. They took her.<eos>
<bos>How do you know?<eos>
<bos>The door was open.<eos>
<bos>Scully.<eos>
<bos>The floor.<eos>
<bos>What do you see?<eos>
<bos>The same thing as out on the road.<eol>We've seen it before.<eos>
<bos>Yeah.<eos>
<bos>I have. We both have.<eos>
<bos>What is it?<eos>
<bos>It's a biological toxin...<eos>
<bos>emitted as a gas through the bloodstream.<eos>
<bos>- From who? - From what is arguably...<eos>
<bos>an alien.<eos>
<bos>Oh.<eos>
<bos>- You okay? - Yeah.<eos>
<bos>You sure?<eos>
<bos>Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks.<eos>
<bos>Thank you, Greta.<eos>
<bos>Why the trouble to bring Krycek here<eol>and then toy with him?<eos>
<bos>Do you trust Alex, Marita?<eos>
<bos>- Then why bring him here at all?<eol>- You misunderstand.<eos>
<bos>I've great faith that Alex<eol>will find the ship.<eos>
<bos>But if I told him how,<eos>
<bos>he'd be tempted to sell the information.<eos>
<bos>- And you're certain it's there?<eol>- Oh, yes.<eos>
<bos>But it won't be there forever.<eos>
<bos>It's rebuilding itself.<eos>
<bos>If he finds the ship, then what?<eos>
<bos>To possess it...<eos>
<bos>is to possess the answer to all things.<eos>
<bos>Every possible imaginable question.<eos>
<bos>To God?<eos>
<bos>There's no God, Marita.<eos>
<bos>What we call God is only alien...<eos>
<bos>an intelligence much greater than us.<eos>
<bos>They're coming here, aren't they?<eos>
<bos>They're only coming back.<eos>
<bos>Mulder?<eos>
<bos>Hey!<eos>
<bos>- You know this guy? - Yeah.<eos>
<bos>- What are you doing, Richie?<eol>- They took him.<eos>
<bos>They took Gary. He-He was just gone.<eos>
<bos>- Relax. Slow down. - They're out there!<eos>
<bos>- I don't care what your dad says, Billy.<eol>- My dad?<eos>
<bos>He was out there too. He knows.<eos>
<bos>I was shining my flashlight<eol>in the dark, looking for the U.F.O.,<eos>
<bos>and, uh,<eos>
<bos>the beam hit this spot in space,<eos>
<bos>like it bent the light.<eos>
<bos>- And then what happened?<eol>- Well, I yelled, "Gary!"<eos>
<bos>- And then what happened?<eol>- Well, I yelled, "Gary!"<eos>
<bos>And I looked, but he wasn't there.<eol>He wasn't anywhere, man.<eos>
<bos>And then the flashlight got really hot,<eol>and I dropped it.<eos>
<bos>Uh, it was right around here somewhere.<eos>
<bos>Oh, hey, here it is.<eos>
<bos>Scully?<eos>
<bos>Scully?<eos>
<bos>- Scully.<eos>
<bos>- You want some water?<eol>- What happened to her?<eos>
<bos>- Can you just get her some water?<eos>
<bos>I just... I just...<eos>
<bos>I just hit the ground.<eos>
<bos>Here, lie still.<eos>
<bos>Why is this happening to me?<eos>
<bos>It's okay. It's okay.<eos>
<bos>- What the hell's going on, Mulder?<eol>- I don't know.<eos>
<bos>But these aren't just<eol>random abductions, Scully.<eos>
<bos>- We've gotta warn Billy Miles of that.<eol>- Of... Of what?<eos>
<bos>These abductees aren't just<eol>systematically being taken.<eos>
<bos>They're not coming back.<eos>
<bos>Dad?<eos>
<bos>Billy?<eos>
<bos>- What are you doing?<eol>- You stay where you are.<eos>
<bos>- Billy, it's me.<eol>- I said, stay where you are!<eos>
<bos>- Damn it, Billy, listen to me. - No.<eos>
<bos>I don't know who you are,<eol>but you are not gonna take me.<eos>
<bos>I'm your father.<eos>
<bos>Are you gonna shoot your father?<eos>
<bos>If you're my father,<eos>
<bos>then why won't you believe me?<eos>
<bos>I believe you, Billy. I...<eos>
<bos>I just want it all to go away.<eos>
<bos>Give me the gun, son.<eos>
<bos>Billy?<eos>
<bos>Billy!<eos>
<bos>- Agent Mulder?<eol>- What's our punishment this time?<eos>
<bos>Thumb screws or 40 lashes?<eos>
<bos>Come on in, Walter. Sit a spell.<eos>
<bos>This could be the last time you<eol>take a trip down to these offices.<eos>
<bos>You went to Oregon.<eos>
<bos>Guilty as charged.<eos>
<bos>And if they're coming down on you<eol>for that, I'm sorry. I truly am.<eos>
<bos>Fortunately, they think that I make<eol>a contribution to the bureau.<eos>
<bos>Oh, well, yeah.<eos>
<bos>Stick to a budget, and they say<eol>you're making a contribution.<eos>
<bos>But push the limits of your profession,<eol>and they say you're out of control.<eos>
<bos>What it comes down to, Agent Mulder,<eol>is... they don't like ya.<eos>
<bos>Well, we didn't bring home<eol>a flying saucer or an alien.<eos>
<bos>Yeah. So I've been told.<eos>
<bos>Agent Mulder! I think<eol>you should listen to him.<eos>
<bos>You've got every reason<eol>to wanna see me dead,<eos>
<bos>but you gotta listen to me now.<eos>
<bos>You're the singular opportunity.<eos>
<bos>- Here, or do you want to step outside?<eol>- Agent Mulder.<eos>
<bos>Cancer Man is dying.<eos>
<bos>His last wish is to rebuild his project,<eos>
<bos>to have us revive the conspiracy.<eos>
<bos>It all begins in Oregon.<eos>
<bos>The ship that collided with<eol>that navy plane... it's in those woods.<eos>
<bos>- There's no ship in those woods.<eol>- Yeah, it's there,<eos>
<bos>cloaked in an energy field<eol>while he mops up the evidence.<eos>
<bos>- Who? - The alien bounty hunter.<eos>
<bos>Billy Miles, Teresa Hoese, her husband.<eos>
<bos>He's eliminating proof of all the tests.<eos>
<bos>See, we're asking ourselves... We're<eol>asking ourselves, "Where are they?"<eos>
<bos>They're right there.<eol>They're right under our noses.<eos>
<bos>But I'm giving you<eol>the chance to change that...<eos>
<bos>to hold the proof.<eos>
<bos>Why me? And why now?<eos>
<bos>I wanna damn the soul of that<eol>cigarette-smoking son of a bitch.<eos>
<bos>Mulder?<eos>
<bos>What's amazing is that even<eol>the military satellites don't see this.<eos>
<bos>ButJ.P.L. 's TOPEX/Poseidon<eol>shows it only as waveform data.<eos>
<bos>And here it appears simply as<eol>a microburst of transmission error...<eos>
<bos>on the European Space Agency's ERS-2.<eos>
<bos>If you didn't know what you<eol>were looking at or looking for.<eos>
<bos>- No wonder we couldn't see them.<eol>- It is not gonna be there forever.<eos>
<bos>As we all stand here talking,<eol>it's rebuilding itself.<eos>
<bos>Mulder, if any of this is true...<eos>
<bos>If it is or if it isn't,<eol>I want you to forget about it.<eos>
<bos>- Forget about it?<eol>- You're not going back out there.<eos>
<bos>It has to end sometime. That time is now.<eos>
<bos>You're an abductee.<eos>
<bos>I'm not gonna risk...<eos>
<bos>Iosing you.<eos>
<bos>I won't let you go alone.<eos>
<bos>This is starting to feel like<eol>the snipe hunt I was afraid of.<eos>
<bos>There's no such thing as a snipe, sir.<eos>
<bos>My ass is on the line here too,<eol>Agent Mulder.<eos>
<bos>I know that.<eos>
<bos>This just can't be.<eos>
<bos>What are you looking at?<eos>
<bos>Medical records. Billy Miles...<eos>
<bos>and other known abductees<eol>in Bellefleur, Oregon.<eos>
<bos>Which is exactly what Mulder<eol>experienced earlier this year.<eos>
<bos>It knocked me back<eol>because it didn't want me.<eos>
<bos>Mulder thinks that it's me<eol>that's in danger of being taken.<eos>
<bos>When it's Mulder who's in danger.<eos>
<bos>Scully?<eos>
<bos>- Scully! - Are you okay?<eos>
<bos>How's it supposed to work?<eos>
<bos>Not exactly sure, sir.<eos>
<bos>- But, um,<eos>
<bos>budgetarily, I'd say<eol>we're looking pretty good.<eos>
<bos>Agent Mulder.!<eos>
<bos>Mulder!<eos>
<bos>Mulder!<eos>
<bos>Mulder.<eos>
<bos>We failed.<eos>
<bos>Perhaps you never meant to succeed.<eos>
<bos>Anyway,<eos>
<bos>the hour is at hand, I presume.<eos>
<bos>What are you doing?<eos>
<bos>Sending the devil back to hell.<eos>
<bos>As you do to Mulder and to me,<eos>
<bos>you do to all of mankind, Alex.<eos>
<bos>Agent Scully.<eos>
<bos>- Hi. - Hi.<eos>
<bos>How are you feeling?<eos>
<bos>I'm feeling fine.<eos>
<bos>They're just running some tests on me.<eos>
<bos>Uh...<eos>
<bos>I already heard.<eos>
<bos>I lost him. I don't know<eol>what else I can say. I lost him.<eos>
<bos>I'll be asked...<eos>
<bos>what I saw.<eos>
<bos>And what I saw I can't deny.<eos>
<bos>I won't.<eos>
<bos>We will find him.<eos>
<bos>I have to.<eos>
<bos>Sir, um,<eos>
<bos>there's something else<eol>I need to tell you.<eos>
<bos>Something that I need<eol>for you to keep to yourself.<eos>
<bos>I'm having a hard time...<eos>
<bos>explaining it...<eos>
<bos>or believing it,<eos>
<bos>but, um,<eos>
<bos>I'm pregnant.<eos>
