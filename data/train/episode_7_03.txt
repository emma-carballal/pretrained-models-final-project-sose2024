<bos>-  Give it up, Mulder!<eos>
<bos>- You've got no chance! - Damn it.<eos>
<bos>My sniper zombies are everywhere.<eos>
<bos>I'll offer you a deal.<eos>
<bos>You give me the Lazarus Bowl,<eol>and I'll give you Scully.<eos>
<bos>Mulder!<eos>
<bos>How 'bout this deal?<eos>
<bos>You give me Scully, I don't smash<eol>the Lazarus Bowl and shove the pieces...<eos>
<bos>where the Son of God don't shine,<eol>you cigarette-smoking mackerel snapper.<eos>
<bos>I break the Lazarus Bowl,<eol>and all your sniper zombies...<eos>
<bos>go back to being good<eol>little well-behaved corpses.<eos>
<bos>You don't fool me, Mulder.<eol>That bowl is your Holy Grail.<eos>
<bos>Encoded in its ancient ceramic grooves<eol>are the words Jesus spake...<eos>
<bos>when he raised Lazarus from the dead.<eos>
<bos>Still capable of raising<eol>the dead 2,000 years later.<eos>
<bos>Proof positive of the paranormal.<eos>
<bos>You can no sooner destroy that<eol>than let the redhead die.<eos>
<bos>Come on, man. Don't break the bowl.<eos>
<bos>We don't wanna go back to being dead.<eos>
<bos>There's no food, no women,<eol>no dancing. Save the bowl,<eos>
<bos>and we'll dump that<eol>ciggy-smoking stooge for you.<eos>
<bos>And you'll be the new king of the dead.<eos>
<bos>I'd rather serve in heaven<eol>than rule in hell.<eos>
<bos>Is that your flashlight, Mulder, or are<eol>you just happy to be lying on top of me?<eos>
<bos>- My flashlight.<eos>
<bos>- Oh, that.<eos>
<bos>For seven long years I've been waiting<eol>for just the right moment, Scully.<eos>
<bos>Oh, you're a sick man, Mulder.<eos>
<bos>Go on.<eos>
<bos>I love you, Scully. No ifs, ands or...<eos>
<bos>"Bs."<eos>
<bos>There were no casualties, no thefts,<eol>no note making any demand.<eos>
<bos>- Who's taking credit for it? - Nobody.<eos>
<bos>She: Jodie Foster's foster child<eol>on a Payless budget.<eos>
<bos>He's like a Jehovah's Witness<eol>meets Harrison Ford's Witness.<eos>
<bos>Uh, Christ's Church.<eol>Isn't that Cardinal O'Fallon's church?<eos>
<bos>Yes, O'Fallon's residence<eol>is adjacent to the crypt.<eos>
<bos>- Who's Cardinal O'Fallon?<eol>- Cardinal "O'Fallen" perhaps.<eos>
<bos>Um, he's one of the most powerful men<eol>in the Church today.<eos>
<bos>His name often comes up as a possibility<eol>for the first American pope.<eos>
<bos>- Oh.<eos>
<bos>- "Myopic."<eos>
<bos>Yes, it does.<eos>
<bos>- Are you gonna answer your phone?<eos>
<bos>- Me? - Yeah.<eos>
<bos>I didn't wanna be rude.<eos>
<bos>- Sir, who the hell is this guy? - Hello.<eos>
<bos>This is Wayne Federman. He's<eol>an old buddy of mine from college.<eos>
<bos>He's a writer out in Hollywood now and<eol>he's working on a F.B.I. -based movie.<eos>
<bos>- He's asked me to give him access.<eol>- A screenwriter?<eos>
<bos>It's actually writer/producer.<eos>
<bos>That's actually just<eol>a hindrance/pain in the neck.<eos>
<bos>Yo, yo, yo. Agent Mulder,<eol>I don't wanna eat your lunch.<eos>
<bos>I'm just here for some<eol>procedural flavor. Just a taste.<eos>
<bos>I have no idea what you just said.<eos>
<bos>Well, the Skin man's filled<eol>me in on your particular bent.<eos>
<bos>He said that you come at things maybe a<eol>little farkatke, a little Star Trekkie,<eos>
<bos>which is the exact vibe I'm looking<eol>for for this thing I'm doing.<eos>
<bos>It's a Silence of the Lambs meets<eol>Greatest Story Ever Told type thing.<eos>
<bos>It's... beautiful and<eol>I will not be in your way.<eos>
<bos>I'll be strictly Heisenbergian.<eos>
<bos>A hologram.<eos>
<bos>where he will act<eol>as an observer on this case.<eos>
<bos>Agent Scully, I require<eol>your services here for the morning.<eos>
<bos>Sir, have I pissed you off...<eos>
<bos>in a way that's more than normal?<eos>
<bos>Hey, whatever.<eos>
<bos>The Church always has enemies,<eol>Agent Mulder.<eos>
<bos>Just some old bones, artifacts, relics,<eos>
<bos>documents that we store<eol>down there in the cold.<eos>
<bos>I like to think of it<eol>as God's refrigerator.<eos>
<bos>- That's a great line. - Thank you.<eos>
<bos>- God's refrigerator. - Wayne, shut up.<eos>
<bos>No treasures to the outside world.<eos>
<bos>Things of negligible monetary value,<eos>
<bos>but great spiritual value<eol>to the Church...<eos>
<bos>ancient devotional texts,<eos>
<bos>medieval relics.<eos>
<bos>How 'bout the Shroud ofTurin?<eos>
<bos>No, I'm afraid not.<eos>
<bos>But we do have the bathrobe of St. Peter.<eos>
<bos>- You're kidding? - Yes, I am.<eos>
<bos>- That's a good line. - Thank you.<eos>
<bos>Wayne, shut up.<eos>
<bos>Who comes down to the crypt here?<eos>
<bos>Only myself.<eos>
<bos>A half a mile of catacombs here.<eos>
<bos>I like to walk here during lunch.<eos>
<bos>That's where the bomb went off.<eos>
<bos>Well, my instinct, Cardinal,<eos>
<bos>is to see this desecration<eol>of the dead less as a murder attempt...<eos>
<bos>and more as a terrorist act.<eos>
<bos>- A message...<eos>
<bos>- Uh, this isn't me. I think it's you.<eos>
<bos>Excuse me.<eos>
<bos>That's, uh... That's not me.<eos>
<bos>Let me check.<eos>
<bos>Not me.<eos>
<bos>We never get reception here.<eos>
<bos>Would that be St. Jude's<eol>cell phone, Cardinal?<eos>
<bos>No.<eos>
<bos>That's Micah Hoffman.<eos>
<bos>Micah Hoffman, Willie Mays<eol>and Frank Serpico.<eos>
<bos>That's my holy trinity, Scully.<eos>
<bos>Of course I'm too young<eol>to remember, but...<eos>
<bos>He was one of the original Weathermen.<eol>He was the first Yippie.<eos>
<bos>He was a better poet than Ginsberg.<eos>
<bos>And he was also the starting shortstop<eol>for his Columbia baseball team.<eos>
<bos>- He was never heard from again.<eol>- The Stones get blamed for everything.<eos>
<bos>- I don't get it.<eol>- This should be it here.<eos>
<bos>What did Skinner want<eol>you for this morning?<eos>
<bos>Just paperwork.<eos>
<bos>Mm-hmm.<eos>
<bos>- Mulder, we should have a warrant.<eol>- It's only the Constitution.<eos>
<bos>No big deal.<eos>
<bos>- Wow. - "Dis-Feng-Shui."<eos>
<bos>Mulder, sorry to denigrate<eol>a third of your trinity,<eos>
<bos>but it looks like Hoffman<eol>was killed by one of his own bombs.<eos>
<bos>Well, from Dharma Bum to Dharma Bomb.<eos>
<bos>I knew Hoffman was a master potter.<eos>
<bos>Well, it appears he was<eol>a master calligrapher as well.<eos>
<bos>Look, Mulder, we've got gum arabic<eol>and sodium hydroxide here.<eos>
<bos>Whew! These would be used to, uh...<eos>
<bos>to age the ink and the paper prematurely.<eos>
<bos>It's a forger's trick.<eos>
<bos>Well, from counterculture<eol>to counterfeiter.<eos>
<bos>All right, one more pun<eol>and I pull out my gun.<eos>
<bos>Scully, look at that. "Cristos. "<eos>
<bos>Looks like a religious text.<eol>Can you read Greek at all?<eos>
<bos>Well, it's pretty rusty.<eos>
<bos>But it looks like<eol>some kind of lost gospel.<eos>
<bos>A gospel of Mary Magdalene.<eos>
<bos>And "An Account of Christ's Life<eol>on Earth After the Resurrection."<eos>
<bos>- After? - Yeah.<eos>
<bos>It's a heretical text, Mulder.<eos>
<bos>Mythical I should say,<eol>but long rumored to be in existence.<eos>
<bos>What would Micah Hoffman be doing<eol>with heretical religious texts?<eos>
<bos>I think the question is, what would<eol>Hoffman be doing forging them?<eos>
<bos>Ay-yi-yi. I think<eol>the real question, Agents,<eos>
<bos>is what might O'Fallon<eol>be doing with Hoffman's forgeries?<eos>
<bos>You don't need a Weatherman<eol>to know which way the wind blows.<eos>
<bos>Don't shoot!<eos>
<bos>I like the way you guys work...<eol>no warrants, no permission, no research.<eos>
<bos>You're like studio executives with guns.<eos>
<bos>Should I call you Agent Mulder<eol>or Mr. Mulder...<eos>
<bos>Like Skin man?<eos>
<bos>Just ignore me.<eos>
<bos>What's that?<eos>
<bos>Looks like the same Gospel of Mary<eol>Scully I.D. 'd over at Hoffman's place.<eos>
<bos>So, is this a forgery<eol>or is this the real thing?<eos>
<bos>Well, there is no real<eol>Gospel of Mary, Federman.<eos>
<bos>The original would be a fake.<eos>
<bos>All right. So is this<eol>a real fake or a fake fake?<eos>
<bos>It's me.<eos>
<bos>Yes? Nothing new. No, I can hear you.<eos>
<bos>It's just your voice is...<eos>
<bos>There's like a crackly sound<eol>and then I hear the syllables.<eos>
<bos>Just talk. You're breaking up.<eos>
<bos>No. Let me call you back. Okay.<eos>
<bos>Yeah, I'm telling you.<eol>I'm going through a crypt.<eos>
<bos>Wow.<eos>
<bos>Oh, my God.<eos>
<bos>Now, Wayne,<eol>I'm sure that it was dark in there...<eos>
<bos>and that your eyes<eol>were playing tricks on you.<eos>
<bos>And you've been influenced<eol>by ghost stories and horror movies...<eos>
<bos>that take place in crypts and graveyards.<eos>
<bos>And you hallucinated this vision<eol>of these dancing bones...<eos>
<bos>trying to reconstruct this bowl.<eos>
<bos>No, I didn't hallucinate.<eos>
<bos>That was mechanical or C.G.I.<eos>
<bos>Federman, that wasn't a movie.<eol>That was real life.<eos>
<bos>The difference being?<eos>
<bos>Well, I have got my flavor here.<eos>
<bos>Well, you know, sometimes truth<eol>can be stranger than fiction.<eos>
<bos>Well, fiction is quicker<eol>than truth and cheaper.<eos>
<bos>You want my advice? You're both crazy.<eos>
<bos>Why do you say that?<eos>
<bos>Well, you're crazy for believing<eol>what you believe and...<eos>
<bos>you're crazy for not believing<eol>what he believes.<eos>
<bos>I'll leave you with that. Thank you.<eos>
<bos>I miss him already.<eos>
<bos>You know, Mulder,<eol>I know that Federman's B.S. ing you.<eos>
<bos>So I'm really hesitant to mention this.<eos>
<bos>But, um, his story reminds<eol>me of the Lazarus Bowl.<eos>
<bos>The Lazarus Bowl?<eos>
<bos>We had this wacky nun in<eol>Catholic school... Sister Callahan.<eos>
<bos>Twisted Sister.<eol>That's my kind of nun, you know.<eos>
<bos>Well, she would hold up an old piece<eol>of wood with a rusty nail in it.<eos>
<bos>Or she'd show us a vial of red liquid...<eos>
<bos>and say that it was<eol>John the Baptist's blood or something.<eos>
<bos>She'd be in prison today.<eol>You realize that?<eos>
<bos>Well, she would tell this story of when<eol>Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead.<eos>
<bos>And that Christ's words, the<eol>actual incantation to raise the dead,<eos>
<bos>were recorded in the clay grooves<eol>of the pottery...<eos>
<bos>just like the way music<eol>is recorded into vinyl.<eos>
<bos>Well, Sr. Spooky...<eos>
<bos>says that these words in the clay...<eos>
<bos>still have the power to raise the dead<eol>just likeJesus raised Lazarus.<eos>
<bos>That is a very cool story<eol>coming from you, Scully.<eos>
<bos>I'll have Chuck Burks<eol>meet you over at my office.<eos>
<bos>See if this clay has<eol>Christ's greatest hits on it.<eos>
<bos>And I'm gonna... I'm gonna go have<eol>another audience with Cardinal O'Fallon.<eos>
<bos>There's music in the air, Agent Scully.<eos>
<bos>See, everything that exists vibrates,<eol>and therefore sings...<eos>
<bos>the street, your internal organs,<eos>
<bos>electricity, everything.<eos>
<bos>Here, I'll show you. You see?<eos>
<bos>This is my voice bouncing around<eol>in the red here.<eos>
<bos>And all this yellow is ambient sound<eol>that we habitually tune out.<eos>
<bos>It's the hum of my hardware,<eos>
<bos>Mulder's porn tapes on pause,<eol>sounds from the street.<eos>
<bos>Everything we hear<eol>but we don't know we hear...<eos>
<bos>I can hear it with this machine.<eos>
<bos>Oh.<eos>
<bos>What is it?<eos>
<bos>Who made this?<eos>
<bos>We're not sure.<eos>
<bos>Either a forger by the name<eol>of Micah Hoffman...<eos>
<bos>or, uh, someone else in the vicinity<eol>ofJesus Christ.<eos>
<bos>"Buzzinga."<eos>
<bos>Whoever did it is some kind<eol>of a musical genius.<eos>
<bos>This clay is vibrating in all<eol>the keys at once. It's heavenly.<eos>
<bos>Can you translate<eol>what it says there for me, please?<eos>
<bos>Did you recover them from the crypt?<eos>
<bos>Yes.<eos>
<bos>"And then Jesus took his beloved<eol>Mary Magdalene in an embrace.<eos>
<bos>"An embrace not of God and woman,<eol>but of man and woman.<eos>
<bos>"And Jesus said to Mary,<eol>'Love the body...<eos>
<bos>"'for it is all of the soul...<eos>
<bos>that our senses can perceive."'<eos>
<bos>And how about these?<eos>
<bos>These appear to be copies<eol>of the original.<eos>
<bos>- Rough drafts. - How?<eos>
<bos>They're all forgeries, sir.<eos>
<bos>Did you buy these from Micah Hoffman?<eos>
<bos>I thought they were real.<eos>
<bos>Yeah, I can understand that.<eol>Hoffman was a master.<eos>
<bos>The paper is authentic, the ink,<eol>the hand, the diction, everything.<eos>
<bos>Hoffman was also an explosives expert.<eos>
<bos>Do you have any idea what he might have<eol>been doing with a bomb in the crypt?<eos>
<bos>Can you think of anybody who might have<eol>wanted to kill Micah Hoffman?<eos>
<bos>No.<eos>
<bos>Why were you hiding the documents, sir?<eos>
<bos>When Micah came to me... with these,<eos>
<bos>as I then thought ancient texts,<eos>
<bos>and our experts verified them,<eos>
<bos>it exploded a bomb in my heart.<eos>
<bos>The Christ that I loved<eol>was not the Christ in these texts.<eos>
<bos>So you bought them in order to hide them.<eos>
<bos>To keep others from<eol>feeling the despair...<eos>
<bos>and the anger that I felt.<eos>
<bos>To protect people from what I can<eol>now see they needed no protection from.<eos>
<bos>Why didn't you just<eol>destroy the documents yourself?<eos>
<bos>I thought they were real.<eos>
<bos>I hated them. I despised them.<eos>
<bos>I would have liked to destroy them,<eol>but I couldn't.<eos>
<bos>Is being made a fool of<eol>a crime, Agent Mulder?<eos>
<bos>I'd be doing life if it were, sir.<eos>
<bos>- Scully.<eos>
<bos>Hey, Scully, it's me. Can you horn in<eol>on the Hoffman autopsy for me?<eos>
<bos>He was blackmailing O'Fallon with those<eol>forgeries. Maybe O'Fallon retaliated.<eos>
<bos>Mulder, this bowl...<eos>
<bos>Your buddy Chuck Burks says that it has<eol>properties he's never seen before.<eos>
<bos>- Hold on a second. That's my other line.<eos>
<bos>- Mulder. -  Agent Mulder?<eos>
<bos>It's Wayne/Federman out in L.A.<eos>
<bos>Listen. Who do you see<eol>playing you in the movie?<eos>
<bos>- I'm in the movie?<eol>- It's a character loosely based on you.<eos>
<bos>- It's more of an amalgamation.<eol>- Hold on a second, Wayne.<eos>
<bos>- Sr. Spooky, I gotta take this.<eol>- I'll call you after the autopsy.<eos>
<bos>Thanks.<eos>
<bos>- How 'bout Richard Gere?<eos>
<bos>Yeah, okay. Seriously.<eos>
<bos>What if I said to you<eol>the name Garry Shandling?<eos>
<bos>Wayne, you're breaking up. It sounded<eol>like you said Garry Shandling.<eos>
<bos>Garry Shandling signed on to play<eol>the amalgamation loosely based on you.<eos>
<bos>And Tea Leoni's playing the amalgamation<eol>loosely based on your partner.<eos>
<bos>You stud.<eol>The movie's called The Lazarus Bowl.<eos>
<bos>- How do you know about the Lazarus Bowl?<eol>- The Skin man.<eos>
<bos>Listen, Shandling and Leoni<eol>wanna meet you guys.<eos>
<bos>Get your flavor.<eol>It's an actor type thing.<eos>
<bos>Come on out to the studio on our dime.<eol>We'll make it nice.<eos>
<bos>Hey, who's... Well, then who's<eol>gonna play Skinner in the movie?<eos>
<bos>- Richard Gere.<eos>
<bos>Fracturing of skull<eol>and surface abrasions...<eos>
<bos>initially consistent<eol>with concussive force injuries.<eos>
<bos>I am, uh, now weighing the heart<eol>which is... relatively normal,<eos>
<bos>although somewhat large.<eos>
<bos>- I'm gonna need that<eol>when you're done with it.<eos>
<bos>Oh, my God!<eos>
<bos>Hoo-yeah!<eos>
<bos>- Who are you? - I am who I am.<eos>
<bos>Uh-uh.<eos>
<bos>Ow! Damn it!<eos>
<bos>What'd you find, Scully?<eos>
<bos>In Micah Hoffman's stomach there were<eol>traces of red wine and strychnine.<eos>
<bos>Man, oh, Manischewitz.<eol>Communion wine I bet.<eos>
<bos>That's possible, Mulder.<eos>
<bos>I could get a warrant for O'Fallon.<eos>
<bos>You are the one God, living and true.<eos>
<bos>Through all eternity<eol>you live an unapproachable life.<eos>
<bos>Mulder, let's allow<eol>the man some dignity, okay?<eos>
<bos>You fill your creatures<eol>with every blessing...<eos>
<bos>and lead all men<eol>to the joyful vision of your life.<eos>
<bos>In our joy, we sing to your glory<eol>with all the choirs of angels.<eos>
<bos>Holy, holy, holy Lord.<eos>
<bos>God of power and might.<eos>
<bos>Heaven and earth are full of your glory.<eos>
<bos>Hosanna in the highest.<eos>
<bos>Blessed is he who comes<eol>in the name of the Lord.<eos>
<bos>Hosanna in the highest.<eos>
<bos>LordJesus Christ,<eol>you said to your apostles,<eos>
<bos>"I leave you in peace.<eol>My peace I give you. "<eos>
<bos>Let's get this over with.<eos>
<bos>And grant us the peace<eol>and unity of your kingdom. Amen.<eos>
<bos>Augustine O'Fallon, you're under arrest<eol>for the murder of Micah Hoffman.<eos>
<bos>- You have the right to remain silent.<eol>- Oh, my God.<eos>
<bos>Do you see what I see?<eos>
<bos>Yes, I do.<eos>
<bos>-  Is that Micah Hoffman? -  Yes, it is.<eos>
<bos>Misidentification of a corpse<eol>and subsequent unrequested autopsy.<eos>
<bos>Sir, the dead man looked<eol>very much like Micah Hoffman.<eos>
<bos>He had Hoffman's I.D. on him.<eos>
<bos>Agent Scully, if I'm carrying<eol>Marilyn Monroe's purse,<eos>
<bos>do you assume that I slept with J.F.K.?<eos>
<bos>But this is the first time, and I hope<eol>you're as proud of this as I am,<eos>
<bos>A bomb went off.<eol>A crime's been committed.<eos>
<bos>There's a dead body<eol>nobody seems to give a damn about.<eos>
<bos>O'Fallon's been less than forthcoming.<eos>
<bos>And Hoffman at the very least<eol>is guilty of forgery and extortion.<eos>
<bos>Agent Mulder, you will<eol>leave O'Fallon alone.<eos>
<bos>Best case scenario,<eol>you get to keep your jobs.<eos>
<bos>which will feature you two<eol>as the sacrificial lambs!<eos>
<bos>As of right now,<eos>
<bos>I think this whole Richard Gere thing<eol>is going to Skinner's head.<eos>
<bos>- We're off this case, Mulder.<eol>-  Compadres.<eos>
<bos>I teased out something very fabulous<eol>from your pottery there.<eos>
<bos>- Layered in under the ambience...<eos>
<bos>There. Guess what language that is.<eos>
<bos>- Chuck, I've had a bad day.<eol>- It's a dead language.<eos>
<bos>I had a linguist in here to listen<eol>to the recording. It's Aramaic.<eos>
<bos>That's the language that Christ spoke.<eos>
<bos>Did your, uh, linguist<eol>happen to translate it?<eos>
<bos>Yes, he did. It's in two parts.<eos>
<bos>The first part, here,<eol>roughly translates as,<eos>
<bos>"I am the walrus. I am the walrus.<eol>Paul is dead. Goo goo g'joob."<eos>
<bos>Although there is<eol>no Aramaic word for walrus.<eos>
<bos>So it literally says,<eol>"I am the bearded cow-like sea beast."<eos>
<bos>- What is it?<eol>- It appears to be one man...<eos>
<bos>commanding another to rise from the dead.<eos>
<bos>Lazarus?<eos>
<bos>I am becomeJesus Christ.<eos>
<bos>I am become skeptical.<eos>
<bos>There I was totally bumming<eol>after Altamont.<eos>
<bos>And I thought, throw in the towel<eol>and go to law school...<eos>
<bos>or continue to fight and become a forger<eol>of scandalous religious documents.<eos>
<bos>I suppose that's a choice every young,<eol>gifted, American male is faced with.<eos>
<bos>I knew O'Fallon from college.<eos>
<bos>- He was a divinity professor of mine.<eol>- At Columbia?<eos>
<bos>Yeah. And he is a decent man,<eol>but with an overweening pride...<eos>
<bos>and sense of responsibility<eol>born of a fundamental...<eos>
<bos>lack of respect for the human animal.<eos>
<bos>He believes in God, but not in man...<eos>
<bos>and man's ability to choose<eol>to live in freedom.<eos>
<bos>He has Christ in his brain,<eol>but not in his heart.<eos>
<bos>So, uh,<eos>
<bos>you created a Christ...<eos>
<bos>in these forgeries that was more suited<eol>to your particular world view?<eos>
<bos>Yeah, but before I could write<eol>like Christ, I had to become him,<eos>
<bos>in much the same way I imagine an actor<eol>who plays a part becomes that part.<eos>
<bos>So I immersed myself in Jesus Christ.<eos>
<bos>Not just the Church and teachings,<eos>
<bos>but the man, the custom of his time,<eos>
<bos>the language, the vibe,<eol>the feeling of Christ.<eos>
<bos>So why didn't O'Fallon and the elders...<eos>
<bos>go outside the Church<eol>for authentification?<eos>
<bos>But then...<eos>
<bos>something truly weird came over me.<eos>
<bos>Remorse?<eos>
<bos>Conversion, Agent Scully.<eos>
<bos>The lightning bolt...<eos>
<bos>that transformed Saul to Paul<eol>on the road to Damascus.<eos>
<bos>One day, I was not just<eol>impersonating Jesus Christ,<eos>
<bos>I had become him.<eos>
<bos>That's why I blew up the crypt.<eos>
<bos>The forgeries were blasphemous<eol>and needed to be destroyed.<eos>
<bos>How did your...<eos>
<bos>cell phone get on<eol>the dead man in the crypt?<eos>
<bos>God works in mysterious ways.<eos>
<bos>God works in mysterious ways.<eos>
<bos>Well, as long as they can think,<eol>we'll have our problems.<eos>
<bos>But those whom they are<eol>using cannot think.<eos>
<bos>They are the dead brought to assimilate<eol>life by our electrode attempts.<eos>
<bos>- It's open!<eos>
<bos>You know, it's an interesting thing<eol>when you consider...<eos>
<bos>you Earth people who can think...<eos>
<bos>are so frightened<eol>by those who cannot... the dead.<eos>
<bos>Couldn't sleep either, huh?<eos>
<bos>- Plan 9 from Outer Space? - Yeah.<eos>
<bos>It's the Ed Wood investigative method.<eos>
<bos>This movie is so profoundly bad<eol>in such a childlike way...<eos>
<bos>that it hypnotizes<eol>my conscious critical mind...<eos>
<bos>and frees up my right brain<eol>to make socio-poetic leaps.<eos>
<bos>And I started flashing<eol>on Hoffman and O'Fallon.<eos>
<bos>How there's this archetypal relationship.<eos>
<bos>Like Hoffman's Jesus to O'Fallon's Judas.<eos>
<bos>Or Hoffman's Jesus to O'Fallon's<eol>Dostoyevsky's grand inquisitor.<eos>
<bos>Or Hoffman's Jesus<eol>to O'Fallon's St. Paul.<eos>
<bos>How 'bout Hoffman's Roadrunner<eol>to O'Fallon's Wile E. Coyote?<eos>
<bos>- Mulder? - Yeah?<eos>
<bos>Do you think it's at all possible<eol>that Hoffman is reallyJesus Christ?<eos>
<bos>Are you making fun of me?<eos>
<bos>No.<eos>
<bos>Well, no, I don't.<eos>
<bos>But crazy people can be very persuasive.<eos>
<bos>Well, yes, I know that.<eos>
<bos>Maybe true faith is really<eol>a form of insanity.<eos>
<bos>- Are you directing that at me? - No!<eos>
<bos>I'm directing it at myself<eol>and at Ed Wood.<eos>
<bos>Well, you know, even a broken clock<eol>is right 730 times a year.<eos>
<bos>- How... - Forty-two.<eos>
<bos>- You've seen this movie 42 times? - Yes.<eos>
<bos>Doesn't that make you sad?<eos>
<bos>It makes me sad.<eos>
<bos>- You ever been to Hollywood?<eol>- A couple of times a few years ago.<eos>
<bos>You're going to be there in the morning.<eos>
<bos>Just a few minutes from Hollywood<eol>in the town of San Fernando.<eos>
<bos>Reports have come in<eol>of saucers flying so low...<eos>
<bos>You know, Scully, we've got four-weeks<eol>probation vacation and nothing to do.<eos>
<bos>And Wayne Federman's invited us out<eol>to L.A. to watch his movie being filmed.<eos>
<bos>And God knows I could use<eol>a little sunshine.<eos>
<bos>Scully?<eos>
<bos>California, here we come.<eos>
<bos>-  Beep, beep.<eos>
<bos>Agents? So glad you could hang.<eos>
<bos>Come on. I want you to meet the people<eol>that are gonna play you.<eos>
<bos>- Nice to meet you. Big fan. Fox Mulder.<eol>- No kidding?<eos>
<bos>You know, while I've got<eol>you here, maybe, uh...<eos>
<bos>maybe you could show me<eol>how to run in these things.<eos>
<bos>Right over here I was thinking<eol>'cause, I tell you...<eos>
<bos>I mean, I'm having a hell<eol>of a time with these heels.<eos>
<bos>- Hey, uh... - Hi.<eos>
<bos>How are you? Seriously, listen.<eol>Can I ask you something?<eos>
<bos>What... What do you mean?<eos>
<bos>Look, when I play a character,<eol>I need to find his center,<eos>
<bos>his sort of rudder, so to say.<eos>
<bos>And then everything comes from that.<eos>
<bos>Uh...<eos>
<bos>I guess mostly to the left.<eos>
<bos>Mostly?<eos>
<bos>Most of the time.<eos>
<bos>Most of the time... to the left.<eos>
<bos>Mm-hmm.<eos>
<bos>Wardrobe!<eos>
<bos>-  Rolling!<eos>
<bos>And "rollando."<eos>
<bos>Come on, now. Kick it in the ass.<eol>And action, zombies!<eos>
<bos>- What is this?<eos>
<bos>Cut. Go ahead, ruin my career.<eol>- What seems to be the problem?<eos>
<bos>What the hell is this?<eol>What the hell's in my mouth?<eos>
<bos>What is Tea Leoni's shoulder made out of?<eos>
<bos>Craft services, what is<eol>Tea Leoni's shoulder made of?<eos>
<bos>- Turkey, just like you asked for.<eol>- Turkey.<eos>
<bos>- Miss Leoni's shoulder's made of turkey.<eol>- Tofu turkey!<eos>
<bos>Tofurkey! I asked for Tofurkey!<eos>
<bos>I'm a vegetarian! Half the zombies<eol>are vegetarians! Oh, my God!<eos>
<bos>The people are made out of turkey.<eos>
<bos>-  Hello?<eol>- Mulder, it's me. What are you doing?<eos>
<bos>I'm, uh, working at the computer.<eol>What are you doing?<eos>
<bos>I'm, uh, packing. Just getting ready<eol>for our trip back to D.C. tomorrow.<eos>
<bos>How come when people<eol>come back from the dead,<eos>
<bos>they always wanna hurt the living?<eos>
<bos>Well, that's because people can't really<eol>come back from the dead, Mulder.<eos>
<bos>Ghosts and zombies are just projections<eol>of our own repressed...<eos>
<bos>cannibalistic and sexual fears<eol>and desires.<eos>
<bos>They are who we fear<eol>that we are at heart.<eos>
<bos>Just mindless automatons<eol>who can only kill and eat.<eos>
<bos>Party pooper. Well, I got a new theory.<eos>
<bos>I say that when zombies try to eat<eol>people, that's just the first stage.<eos>
<bos>So first they're gonna eat,<eol>then they're gonna drink.<eos>
<bos>Then they're gonna dance and make love.<eos>
<bos>Oh, I see. So it's just that we never<eol>get to stay with them long enough...<eos>
<bos>to see the gentler side of the undead.<eos>
<bos>- Exactly.<eos>
<bos>Hold on a second.<eol>That's my other line. Hello?<eos>
<bos>No, sir. I'm just at the computer.<eos>
<bos>Oh. I appreciate that, Skin man.<eos>
<bos>- Don't call me that. - Yes, sir.<eos>
<bos>- Um, where are you now?<eol>- I'm right underneath you.<eos>
<bos>I'm in L.A. at the same hotel as you,<eol>right below you and Agent Scully.<eos>
<bos>Federman got me an associate producer<eol>credit on the movie.<eos>
<bos>A.P. Skinner, huh?<eos>
<bos>Uh, so what are you up to right now, sir?<eos>
<bos>I'm taking a bubble bath.<eos>
<bos>Uh, hold on just one second, sir.<eos>
<bos>Hey, Scully, Skin man is calling me<eol>from a bubble bath.<eos>
<bos>It's still me, Mulder.<eos>
<bos>Uh, sorry. Just-Just hold on<eol>one second, sir.<eos>
<bos>- Scully? - Yeah.<eos>
<bos>Skinner is calling me from a bubble bath.<eos>
<bos>Wow. He's really gone Hollywood.<eos>
<bos>- Totally. - You know, Mulder,<eos>
<bos>speaking of Hollywood, I think that<eol>Tea Leoni has a little crush on you.<eos>
<bos>Oh, yeah, right. Like Tea Leoni's<eol>ever gonna have a crush on me.<eos>
<bos>I think that Shandling<eol>likes you a bit too.<eos>
<bos>Really?<eos>
<bos>I love you, Scully.<eos>
<bos>- No, ifs, ands or... - "Bs."<eos>
<bos>Wait. Wait, Mulder. I can't.<eos>
<bos>I know this feels<eol>wrong because we're friends...<eos>
<bos>and we treat each other as equals, but...<eos>
<bos>No. No, it's not that. It's not that.<eos>
<bos>Well, what then?<eos>
<bos>I'm in love with Assistant<eol>Director Walter Skinner.<eos>
<bos>- What does he have that I don't have?<eol>- A bigger flashlight.<eos>
<bos>I've been looking all over for you.<eos>
<bos>They got it so wrong, Scully.<eos>
<bos>I got a page from the Washington bureau.<eos>
<bos>Micah Hoffman was murdered tonight.<eos>
<bos>Murdered in his own home<eol>by Cardinal O'Fallon,<eos>
<bos>who then hanged himself.<eos>
<bos>A murder/suicide.<eos>
<bos>It's Jesus and Judas, Scully.<eos>
<bos>Well, it's all over now.<eos>
<bos>No, no.<eos>
<bos>It's just beginning.<eos>
<bos>Hoffman and O'Fallon<eol>were these complicated,<eos>
<bos>flawed, beautiful people.<eos>
<bos>And now they'll just be remembered<eol>as jokes because of this movie.<eos>
<bos>How silly is that?<eos>
<bos>- Pretty silly. - And what about us?<eos>
<bos>How are we gonna be remembered<eol>now because of this movie?<eos>
<bos>Well, hopefully the movie will tank.<eos>
<bos>And it'll all become oversimplified...<eos>
<bos>and trivialized and<eol>Cigarette-Smoking "Pontificized"...<eos>
<bos>and become as plastic and meaningless...<eos>
<bos>as this stupid plastic Lazarus Bowl.<eos>
<bos>I think the dead are beyond caring<eol>what people think about them.<eos>
<bos>Hopefully we can adopt the same attitude.<eos>
<bos>You do know that there aren't<eol>real dead people out there, right?<eos>
<bos>That this is a movie set?<eos>
<bos>- The dead are everywhere, Scully.<eos>
<bos>Well, we're alive.<eos>
<bos>And we're relatively young.<eos>
<bos>that he has given us<eol>a bureau credit card...<eos>
<bos>to use for the evening.<eos>
<bos>Come on.<eos>
<bos>Mulder, I have something to confess.<eos>
<bos>Ah, me too.<eos>
