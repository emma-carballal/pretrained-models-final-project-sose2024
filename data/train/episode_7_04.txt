<bos>Cops is filmed on location...<eos>
<bos>with the men and women<eol>of law enforcement.<eos>
<bos>All suspects are innocent until<eol>proven guilty in a court of law.<eos>
<bos>Yeah, I don't know<eol>what it is about a full moon.<eos>
<bos>It's just, uh... There's something<eol>about it. People just go off the wall.<eos>
<bos>These are some pretty scary<eol>neighborhoods to begin with.<eos>
<bos>I haven't been on the job<eol>that long myself,<eos>
<bos>but I've seen more than<eol>my fair share of crazy stuff.<eos>
<bos>When the moon is full,<eol>it's just like times ten.<eos>
<bos>I don't know, uh... I don't know.<eos>
<bos>Maybe it's the tides or something.<eos>
<bos>But irregardless, we're on the job.<eos>
<bos>And if that makes people breathe a<eol>little easier knowing we're out there...<eos>
<bos>or being a little less nervous<eol>walking the streets at night,<eos>
<bos>well, that's a good feeling.<eos>
<bos>Okay.<eos>
<bos>We got a report of somebody lurking<eol>around the neighborhood making noise.<eos>
<bos>Actually, I take that back.<eol>We got a report of a...<eos>
<bos>a monster lurking around<eol>the neighborhood.<eos>
<bos>What... Hey, it's a full moon.<eos>
<bos>A lot of drug activity in this district.<eos>
<bos>We're probably looking at<eol>somebody rattlin' doorknobs...<eos>
<bos>trying to steal some money<eol>for a quick fix.<eos>
<bos>Usually, they're not<eol>the stealthiest of criminals,<eos>
<bos>so maybe we'll get lucky,<eos>
<bos>sneak up on 'em.<eos>
<bos>212-Adam is 10-97.<eos>
<bos>212-Adam is 10-97 at 543 Vogel.<eos>
<bos>212-Adam to Dispatch.<eol>I don't see anything.<eos>
<bos>Can you let the lady know<eol>inside her house... know I'm out here?<eos>
<bos>212-Adam, copy your request. Calling now.<eos>
<bos>- Figures, doesn't it? Psst!<eos>
<bos>A lot of scratches.<eos>
<bos>Maybe a big dog's probably what she saw.<eos>
<bos>Sheriff s Department!<eos>
<bos>Uh...<eos>
<bos>- Senora?<eos>
<bos>Man, she's scared of somethin'.<eos>
<bos>- Hey, you, there!<eos>
<bos>You, freeze! Sheriff s Department!<eos>
<bos>Freeze! Sheriff s Department!<eos>
<bos>Run! Run to the car!<eol>Back to the car, now!<eos>
<bos>Now! Run!<eos>
<bos>Run, Run!<eos>
<bos>- Now! Now! Come on! Get up! Go, go, go!<eos>
<bos>Back to the car! Come on! Run!<eos>
<bos>Run!<eos>
<bos>Get in the car! Get in the car!<eos>
<bos>Holy Come on!<eos>
<bos>- 10-33! 10-33!<eol>Patrol Adam needs assistance!<eos>
<bos>I need assistance at the 500 block<eol>of Vogel! I need assistance!<eos>
<bos>I need... 9-9-9! 9-9-9!<eos>
<bos>Everybody all right?<eos>
<bos>Hey, you all right? You all right?<eos>
<bos>Keith. What was this?<eos>
<bos>I was responding to a 9-21<eol>at this house right here, and, uh...<eos>
<bos>- It was a prowler call.<eol>- You flipped it?<eos>
<bos>No, no. Hell, no, I didn't...<eol>I didn't flip it.<eos>
<bos>It was... We were parked.<eos>
<bos>The... We were attacked.<eos>
<bos>- By who? By gangbangers? - Uh...<eos>
<bos>Okay. Fan out and search.<eos>
<bos>Hey, you'd better double everybody up.<eos>
<bos>Okay, hold on a minute.<eol>Uh, everybody double up.<eos>
<bos>Set up a command post<eol>and check on that air shift.<eos>
<bos>How many? Keith? Keith?<eos>
<bos>Um, you know,<eol>I didn't get a good look. Maybe...<eos>
<bos>4-17 suspects<eol>on foot just one block north of Holly.<eos>
<bos>Armed suspects! Bring some units<eol>around side Holly Street!<eos>
<bos>Get your hands up! Get your hands up!<eos>
<bos>We're the F.B.I.!<eos>
<bos>- Turn around!<eol>- I've got I.D. in my back pocket!<eos>
<bos>- We're investigating a case!<eol>- Hands behind your head!<eos>
<bos>- Check the I.D.!<eos>
<bos>Hands behind your head!<eos>
<bos>Check my I.D. in the back pocket.<eos>
<bos>They're both F.B.I.<eol>Give 'em back their guns.<eos>
<bos>- Thank you.<eol>-  We're investigating a case.<eos>
<bos>- What case?<eol>- Same case you're working on.<eos>
<bos>- So who we looking for?<eol>- Not "who." What.<eos>
<bos>- Mulder, what the hell is going on here?<eol>- I don't know.<eos>
<bos>- You okay? You all right?<eol>-  See the claw marks here?<eos>
<bos>- You okay? You all right?<eol>-  See the claw marks here?<eos>
<bos>Someone tried to get in.<eos>
<bos>Hey, Deputy? Deputy, can you describe<eol>for me what you saw?<eos>
<bos>Um... Well, I mean, it's pretty dark,<eos>
<bos>and I-I didn't really see.<eos>
<bos>- I don't know what... I don't know.<eol>- You must've seen something...<eos>
<bos>in order to run away from it.<eos>
<bos>Huh? You were responding<eol>to the same call we were...<eos>
<bos>of a monster prowling the neighborhood.<eos>
<bos>We've been to this house before.<eol>The lady has a history of medication.<eos>
<bos>There's been half a dozen such sightings<eol>in this area in the past 60 days.<eos>
<bos>Were you aware of that?<eos>
<bos>- No. - Yeah.<eos>
<bos>Also, these sightings only occur<eol>on nights when there's a full moon,<eos>
<bos>- Which tells me something. -  What?<eos>
<bos>What you saw was large, right?<eol>Maybe seven, eight feet tall...<eos>
<bos>when it stood up on its two legs,<eol>and it was covered in fur...<eos>
<bos>and had glowing red eyes and claws...<eos>
<bos>claws sharp enough to gouge<eol>the wood off that front door.<eos>
<bos>- You're not serious?<eol>- And dare I forget teeth?<eos>
<bos>It bit you, didn't it?<eol>Yeah, look at that.<eos>
<bos>Deputy, how long were you gonna<eol>hide that from the E.M.T. s?<eos>
<bos>- I don't...<eol>- Where'd you get that, Keith?<eos>
<bos>I don't even know where that came from.<eos>
<bos>I mean, I didn't see anything<eol>that he's talking about.<eos>
<bos>Big teeth, eight feet tall.<eos>
<bos>- What the hell are you describing?<eol>- A werewolf.<eos>
<bos>- Excuse me? - It's what did that.<eos>
<bos>It also attacked one Hymen Escallera<eol>29 days ago during the last full moon.<eos>
<bos>Hymen died of his wounds<eol>in Compton General Hospital,<eos>
<bos>but not before giving a detailed<eol>description of what attacked him.<eos>
<bos>My partner and I are here to catch it.<eos>
<bos>Unfortunately, though, Deputy,<eol>you've been bitten.<eos>
<bos>The skin is broken.<eos>
<bos>Werewolf law pretty much<eol>universally holds that...<eos>
<bos>- So... - Wait a minute. I mean...<eos>
<bos>But see, that's not really<eol>what happened, though.<eos>
<bos>I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to<eol>be isolated and kept under guard.<eos>
<bos>With all due respect, what the<eol>are you talkin'about?<eos>
<bos>- Can I see your badge again?<eol>- Agent Mulder?<eos>
<bos>Can we have a word a second?<eos>
<bos>Excuse me. What is it?<eos>
<bos>What is it? Mulder, have you noticed<eol>that we're on television?<eos>
<bos>I don't think it's live television,<eol>Scully. She just said<eos>
<bos>But it's a camera, and it's recording.<eos>
<bos>It's recording everything that you<eol>are saying. Do you understand that?<eos>
<bos>I just wanna make sure<eol>that you're clear on that.<eos>
<bos>Sure, I'm clear on that, Scully.<eos>
<bos>My point being, Mulder,<eol>that we are on a case.<eos>
<bos>Well, this presents an opportunity.<eol>I feel we're very close here.<eos>
<bos>And the possibility of capturing<eol>concrete proof of the paranormal...<eos>
<bos>- What's not to love? - Well...<eos>
<bos>I may not agree with you, but at least<eol>I'm not gonna hold it against you.<eos>
<bos>But this... Mulder,<eol>this could ruin your career.<eos>
<bos>What career?<eos>
<bos>Scully, I appreciate it.<eol>You don't want me looking foolish.<eos>
<bos>I do. I appreciate that.<eos>
<bos>I don't want me looking foolish, Mulder.<eos>
<bos>Okay, fine. Well, do me a favor.<eos>
<bos>Will you just escort<eol>Deputy Wetzel to the hospital?<eos>
<bos>Just keep an eye on him<eol>in case I'm right? Thank you.<eos>
<bos>- I'm gonna call Skinner, Mulder. - Okay.<eos>
<bos>I'm sure he's gonna wanna say<eol>a couple words about this.<eos>
<bos>Guys, give it a rest, huh?<eos>
<bos>She says, uh... I guess<eol>she's calling it a claw monster...<eos>
<bos>was trying to break<eol>into the house and get her.<eos>
<bos>Uh, it was big and had claws<eol>pretty much. Keeps going on and on.<eos>
<bos>Yeah, all right. Tell her to describe it<eol>in detail to the sketch artist.<eos>
<bos>- Will you work with her? Yeah.<eol>- Claw monster?<eos>
<bos>- Just do it, Ricky. - Okay.<eos>
<bos>Hey, look at that. Excuse me.<eos>
<bos>Look at this. It's like five claw marks.<eos>
<bos>- Agent, you seriously believe... - Huh?<eos>
<bos>we're lookin' for some kind of a...<eos>
<bos>I'll show you.<eos>
<bos>This.<eos>
<bos>This is what Hymen Escallera described...<eos>
<bos>just before succumbing to his injuries.<eos>
<bos>Ten to one, that's what<eol>Mrs. Guerrero's gonna describe too.<eos>
<bos>Sir? Sir? We got your suspect.<eos>
<bos>Claw monster! Claw monster!<eos>
<bos>Claw monster. Boy, you know,<eol>they kill him in every movie,<eos>
<bos>and he just keeps coming back.<eos>
<bos>- Now, this is... this is strange.<eol>- Mm-hmm.<eos>
<bos>Gracias, Mrs. Guerrero.<eol>We're lookin' for gangbangers.<eos>
<bos>Um, you don't think it's some guy<eol>dressed up like Freddy Krueger, do you?<eos>
<bos>Can somebody walk me to my car? It's<eol>dark out, and I'm parked up the street.<eos>
<bos>Yeah, come on, Ricky.<eol>I'll walk you to your car.<eos>
<bos>- Can I return this vest later?<eol>- Yeah, you can return the vest later.<eos>
<bos>You catch?<eos>
<bos>- Catch-Catch him? - Si. Si.<eos>
<bos>You catch.<eos>
<bos>How's Deputy Wetzel?<eos>
<bos>- You let him get released? - Well,<eos>
<bos>those weren't teeth marks, Mulder.<eos>
<bos>They turned out to be insect bites.<eos>
<bos>Individual welts or stings of some sort.<eos>
<bos>Together, they just look like<eol>a larger pattern,<eos>
<bos>especially when we want them to.<eos>
<bos>Although, it was<eol>an understandable conclusion...<eos>
<bos>that I'm sure anybody would have made.<eos>
<bos>So what did Skinner say?<eos>
<bos>He said that the F.B.I.<eol>has nothing to hide,<eos>
<bos>and neither do we.<eos>
<bos>If it makes you feel any better,<eol>I'm not entirely convinced...<eos>
<bos>that we're looking for<eol>a werewolf anymore.<eos>
<bos>- Oh. All right. Good.<eol>- Yeah, it's something else.<eos>
<bos>I'm not sure what.<eol>Some other kind of creature though.<eos>
<bos>- I have a... Hey, what's going on?<eos>
<bos>Six blocks from here.<eol>Could be what we're looking for.<eos>
<bos>No. You go with someone else.<eos>
<bos>Man down at the corner of...<eos>
<bos>Guys, watch out. I'm a doctor.<eos>
<bos>Oh, man, it's Ricky.<eos>
<bos>That's what I was afraid of, Scully.<eos>
<bos>When a fellow officer<eol>goes down in the line of duty,<eos>
<bos>or even if it's...<eol>even if it's not a fellow officer...<eos>
<bos>if it's just somebody working<eol>part-time with the department...<eos>
<bos>in a support, uh...<eos>
<bos>artistic capacity...<eos>
<bos>like Ricky there... we all feel it.<eos>
<bos>Uh, that there is<eol>every cop's worst nightmare.<eos>
<bos>But that's when you gotta<eol>cowboy up and give 150 percent...<eos>
<bos>and catch the bad guys.<eos>
<bos>Last call from his phone<eol>was made to the Road Club.<eos>
<bos>Ricky called in requesting roadside<eol>assistance for his flat tire.<eos>
<bos>He asked them to hurry.<eol>He said he didn't feel safe.<eos>
<bos>- What's that? - Our suspect, apparently.<eos>
<bos>- The slash marks match up pretty well,<eos>
<bos>wouldn't you say?<eos>
<bos>Somebody lost a nail.<eos>
<bos>Nice color.<eos>
<bos>Check out this color, Mulder.<eos>
<bos>Blood red.<eos>
<bos>Hey, uh, who called 911 on this?<eos>
<bos>-  Steve and Edy? Sergeant Paula.<eos>
<bos>The Steve and Edy?<eos>
<bos>They're good folk. They usually call us<eol>if there's trouble in the neighborhood.<eos>
<bos>- Ooh. - Oh, my God! Look at this!<eos>
<bos>- Look at all these people. Lord!<eol>- How are you doin' this evening?<eos>
<bos>Not with me lookin' like this. Mm-mmm.<eos>
<bos>Now, you should know<eol>better than that, Sergeant Paula!<eos>
<bos>Like she gonna run from a camera.<eol>Look it here.<eos>
<bos>We heard all this screamin',<eol>peeked out the window,<eos>
<bos>and this boy with crazy hair<eol>was having a conniption fit...<eos>
<bos>all rolled up there by the phone.<eos>
<bos>You didn't see his... his attacker?<eos>
<bos>- Mmm. - I'm ready for my close-up.<eos>
<bos>Ain't nobody care about your scabby ass.<eol>This is police business.<eos>
<bos>- What? - Now, I didn't see...<eos>
<bos>- What'd you say? Attacker? - Attacker.<eos>
<bos>Did you see anything...<eos>
<bos>that looked like this?<eos>
<bos>- Ooh, stop! - Or this?<eos>
<bos>- Ooh! Excuse me?<eol>- That's gonna give me nightmares.<eos>
<bos>- So you didn't see anything at all?<eol>- Uh-uh. No.<eos>
<bos>Did you, uh... Did you see a woman?<eos>
<bos>- Mmm. Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm.<eos>
<bos>- Sure do. - Chantara a streetwalker?<eos>
<bos>- Mm-hmm. She work the corner. - Mm-hmm.<eos>
<bos>- She on the pipe, so we don't associate.<eol>- Oh, yeah.<eos>
<bos>- Mm-mmm. No. - You know what I'm sayin'?<eos>
<bos>Well, we should go...<eol>We should go talk to Chantara then.<eos>
<bos>- Well, I wish you would. Mm-hmm.<eol>- That's right.<eos>
<bos>Hey! Hey! When I'm a-get my own TV show?<eos>
<bos>- If I didn't care<eol>- Oh, she's showin' off now.<eos>
<bos>- More than words can say<eol>- Stop! Stop! Get in there! Stop this!<eos>
<bos>- Would you excuse us? Excuse us.<eol>- If I didn't care<eos>
<bos>Get in there! Stop this! Bye, y'all. Bye.<eos>
<bos>So apparently, we're on the lookout...<eos>
<bos>for someone whose hair<eol>matches her fingernails.<eos>
<bos>Bubblegum pink. That would be<eol>a good color for you, Scully.<eos>
<bos>I'd have to say that at this point<eol>in the investigation,<eos>
<bos>I'm-I'm usually a little more secure...<eos>
<bos>in-in what it is<eol>we're actually investigating.<eos>
<bos>But we've had so many conflicting<eol>eyewitness reports...<eos>
<bos>that it's hard to ascertain exactly<eol>what it is we're looking for.<eos>
<bos>But the crimes we are investigating<eol>are... are paranormal.<eos>
<bos>I can say that...<eos>
<bos>with absolute conviction.<eos>
<bos>in any kind of rigorous scientific<eol>level, as Agent Scully will tell you.<eos>
<bos>- Oh, yeah.<eol>- Yeah, which in its own way...<eos>
<bos>is a kind of a validation, if<eol>you think about it, in and of itself.<eos>
<bos>But, you know, that's our job.<eol>That's why they pay us the big bucks.<eos>
<bos>Bubblegum pink.<eos>
<bos>- Don't run! F.B.I.! - Chantara Gomez?<eos>
<bos>- Chantara... - Chantara Gomez?<eos>
<bos>- Don't run! It's okay.<eos>
<bos>- It's okay.<eos>
<bos>- It's all right. - Chantara Gomez?<eos>
<bos>- Can I see your hands, please?<eol>- I didn't do nothing!<eos>
<bos>- Can I see your hands, please?<eol>It's okay.<eos>
<bos>- We need to see your hands.<eol>- Show her your hands.<eos>
<bos>Earlier this evening, a man<eol>was attacked. He was badly slashed.<eos>
<bos>And do you realize that<eol>this places you at the crime scene?<eos>
<bos>Fisher and Delmont. That's<eol>your usual hang, isn't it, Chantara?<eos>
<bos>Look, I heard screaming, okay?<eol>And I went and I tried to help this guy.<eos>
<bos>And when I heard the sirens, I just<eol>ran away, okay? I didn't do nothing!<eos>
<bos>Look, I believe you.<eol>I think you saw something.<eos>
<bos>You witnessed something.<eol>Tell me what it is.<eos>
<bos>- I can't. - You can tell us, Chantara.<eos>
<bos>- Come on. It's okay. - Chantara.<eos>
<bos>If you're afraid that what you tell us,<eol>we're not gonna believe it, don't be.<eos>
<bos>So whatever it is you saw tonight,<eos>
<bos>whatever it is,<eol>whatever you think you saw,<eos>
<bos>however strange or terrifying or bizarre,<eos>
<bos>you are not gonna surprise me.<eos>
<bos>Okay?<eos>
<bos>You'll protect me from Chuko?<eos>
<bos>- Who's Chuko? - Mi novio.<eos>
<bos>He's the one who cut that guy up,<eol>not me! I didn't do anything!<eos>
<bos>- I'm sorry. What?<eol>- Mi novio. Her boyfriend.<eos>
<bos>No, I got that.<eos>
<bos>Look, he's been chasing me<eol>for a week, okay?<eos>
<bos>- Chuko. - Chuko Munos.<eos>
<bos>The cops know who he is.<eos>
<bos>This is my favorite part of the job...<eol>knockin' down crack houses.<eos>
<bos>I heard that.<eos>
<bos>I don't understand.<eol>I told you everything you need to know!<eos>
<bos>- Chantara, first of all,<eol>- I just wanna go home now!<eos>
<bos>He's gonna kill me! You don't<eol>understand! He's gonna kill me!<eos>
<bos>He told me he was gonna<eol>twist my neck off like a chicken!<eos>
<bos>Chantara, no one's gonna kill you.<eos>
<bos>You see all the deputies here?<eol>You see? No one is going to get you.<eos>
<bos>- Now, what's more, Deputy Wetzel here...<eos>
<bos>is going to keep an eye on you<eol>while we go and put the cuffs on Chuko.<eos>
<bos>No one is going to get you.<eos>
<bos>Chuko Munos. The man himself.<eos>
<bos>Only distinguishing feature<eol>is a tattoo on his skull.<eos>
<bos>- He's not our guy. - What do you mean?<eos>
<bos>I don't care how bad his rep is,<eol>he can't turn over a squad car.<eos>
<bos>Maybe not by himself,<eol>but he's probably got friends, right?<eos>
<bos>There's something else going on.<eos>
<bos>Let's hit it.<eos>
<bos>Units on a warrant.<eol>Let's hold all radio traffic.<eos>
<bos>Go, go, go!<eos>
<bos>Hands above your head!<eol>Get your hands above your head!<eos>
<bos>- Clear above your head!<eol>- Let's see your hands!<eos>
<bos>- Have you seen Chuko Munos?<eol>-  you, mother... [Bleep]<eos>
<bos>Put your hands on the wall! On the wall!<eos>
<bos>Get your  hands off me.<eos>
<bos>Oh, man.<eos>
<bos>Agents! Agents, in here.<eos>
<bos>Hey, what happened? Wake up.<eos>
<bos>- What happened to your friend in there?<eol>- Check the tattoo.<eos>
<bos>- Looks like he O.D. 'd.<eol>- Yeah, but how long ago?<eos>
<bos>Couple days. Maybe a week.<eos>
<bos>He didn't attack Ricky Kola,<eol>that's for sure.<eos>
<bos>- Shots fired!<eos>
<bos>- It's here! - What?<eos>
<bos>- It's gettin'away!<eol>- What you got? What you shooting at?<eos>
<bos>What are you shooting at?<eol>Keith, what are you doin'?<eos>
<bos>It came back. It was here.<eos>
<bos>-  It-It was here. - Keith!<eos>
<bos>Oh, man. I heard her screamin',<eol>and I tried to...<eos>
<bos>I tried to stop it.<eol>I swear to you, I tried.<eos>
<bos>- I did everything I could do.<eol>- Oh, sh...<eos>
<bos>I did everything I could do.<eos>
<bos>What is it, Mulder?<eos>
<bos>What...<eos>
<bos>I wish someone would explain<eol>to me what the hell is going on here.<eos>
<bos>It just doesn't make sense.<eos>
<bos>Keith Wetzel may be a little green,<eol>but he is a solid deputy.<eos>
<bos>Nothing could've gotten past him<eol>and killed that woman.<eos>
<bos>There's no sign of what he was<eol>shooting at. This is all we found.<eos>
<bos>Nine millimeter. It's our issue.<eos>
<bos>Doesn't look like a ricochet.<eos>
<bos>Maybe Wetzel hit what he was aiming at.<eol>Excuse me.<eos>
<bos>Hey, Deputy.<eos>
<bos>You ready to talk to me now?<eos>
<bos>You and I both know you saw something.<eol>We're way past claiming you didn't.<eos>
<bos>I only know what I thought I saw.<eos>
<bos>Well, describe it for me.<eos>
<bos>The Wasp Man.<eos>
<bos>The Wasp Man?<eos>
<bos>- It's ridicu... It's ridiculous.<eos>
<bos>Scary stories my older brother<eol>used to tell me when I was a kid...<eos>
<bos>about a monster, head like a wasp...<eos>
<bos>and a mouth full of stingers<eol>instead of teeth.<eos>
<bos>He said that it would<eol>come get me in my sleep,<eos>
<bos>and that... and that it would<eol>sting me to death.<eos>
<bos>So you're saying that the Wasp Man<eol>attacked you both times...<eos>
<bos>- Here and earlier in the patrol car?<eol>- I...<eos>
<bos>I'm not saying that<eol>that's what it was, okay?<eos>
<bos>I mean, they didn't see it.<eol>It's not on the videotape.<eos>
<bos>This-This can't be real.<eos>
<bos>No, I think maybe it can.<eol>Just relax a minute. Excuse me.<eos>
<bos>Scully, we came on this case<eol>lookin' for a werewolf, right?<eos>
<bos>No, you did. That's correct.<eos>
<bos>Hymen Escallera claimed<eol>he was attacked by a werewolf,<eos>
<bos>and the wounds that he sustained<eol>would seem to bear that out, right?<eos>
<bos>And then, uh,<eol>Wetzel over here sees a wasp man...<eos>
<bos>with stingers for teeth,<eol>and he gets a bite mark...<eos>
<bos>that you say is irrefutably<eol>insect-like, right?<eos>
<bos>Mulder, that's not exactly...<eos>
<bos>And another eyewitness<eol>claims she sees Freddy Krueger.<eos>
<bos>Scully, what if... what if<eol>we're dealing with one creature,<eos>
<bos>one entity, that when it attacks appears<eol>to you as your worst nightmare?<eos>
<bos>Fear. Maybe that's what<eol>this thing feeds on.<eos>
<bos>how would one catch something like that?<eos>
<bos>Probably by... by figuring out<eol>how it chooses its prey.<eos>
<bos>I mean, they're...<eol>It seems to spread like a contagion.<eos>
<bos>One person's fear becomes the next.<eol>There's a definite chain of victims.<eos>
<bos>Tonight it went from Mrs. Guerrero<eol>to Wetzel and the sketch artist.<eos>
<bos>And then from the sketch artist<eol>to Chantara Gomez.<eos>
<bos>- And then... Right.<eol>- Chantara Gomez back to Wetzel.<eos>
<bos>- But you're missing someone, Mulder.<eol>- Who?<eos>
<bos>Edy. Steve and Edy.<eos>
<bos>They're a part of this chain too.<eos>
<bos>And according to your theory,<eol>they would've been attacked, right?<eos>
<bos>So we're back at the home<eol>of Steve and Edy.<eos>
<bos>We should probably check on them because<eol>they seem to fit a victim profile.<eos>
<bos>I'm sorry. Are you talking to me?<eos>
<bos>What the hell are...<eol>What the hell is this?<eos>
<bos>Steve, are you gonna be all right?<eos>
<bos>- I'm all right.<eol>Somebody ask if I'm all right.!<eos>
<bos>I'm the victim! I'm the victim here!<eol>He don't treat me right.<eos>
<bos>- All right.<eol>- You better appreciate me, or I'll walk!<eos>
<bos>He treats my mama with disrespect!<eol>He treats me with disrespect!<eos>
<bos>- See? You! You shut up! - Settle down.<eos>
<bos>He won't make love to me.<eos>
<bos>Oh. Uh...<eos>
<bos>- Oh, no, no! - Look, you guys.<eos>
<bos>Steve, Edy, the reason why we are here...<eos>
<bos>is because we are concerned<eol>about your safety.<eos>
<bos>- How's that?<eol>- We're concerned about your lives.<eos>
<bos>You witnessed a violent attack<eol>right across the street from your house.<eos>
<bos>So you say! I just saw<eol>a rolled up boy with crazy hair!<eos>
<bos>Well, take our word for it.<eol>Because of your proximity to the attack,<eos>
<bos>we think you may be targeted as well.<eos>
<bos>- Why? Because we called the police?<eol>- No, no, no.<eos>
<bos>That's not why.<eol>I can't really explain it exactly, but...<eos>
<bos>I think the key is to remain<eol>unemotional, okay?<eos>
<bos>Try to stay calm.<eol>Try to keep your heart rate down.<eos>
<bos>Try to keep your adrenaline down.<eol>Try to...<eos>
<bos>- Just try to relax. -  Oh, no!<eos>
<bos>Good luck! You don't know<eol>who you're talkin'to about that!<eos>
<bos>Oh, you!<eos>
<bos>Yeah, I think maybe we should<eol>stay here for a little while.<eos>
<bos>All right, let's just...<eos>
<bos>let's just... let's just, uh, relax.<eos>
<bos>Just relax.<eos>
<bos>Mr. Mulder, lookee here.<eos>
<bos>I got to go to bed.<eos>
<bos>How ya doin', Edy? You still upset?<eos>
<bos>I'm scared.<eos>
<bos>You're scared?<eos>
<bos>I'm scared he's gonna leave me.<eos>
<bos>Oh!<eos>
<bos>No, man. No.<eos>
<bos>You think we should take 'em to a hotel?<eos>
<bos>- We don't need no hotel. - Mm-mmm.<eos>
<bos>- Ain't nobody gonna chase us out.<eol>- Mm-mmm.<eos>
<bos>- You're not afraid?<eol>- Now, I didn't say that.<eos>
<bos>I said ain't nobody gonna chase us out.<eos>
<bos>- Mm-mmm. - No.<eos>
<bos>Oh, God. More of you?<eos>
<bos>- Are we any closer to an arrest?<eol>- I'm afraid not.<eos>
<bos>- Mulder, what next? - Well, I'd say...<eos>
<bos>we should station<eol>a couple deputies out here,<eos>
<bos>but I don't think it's coming back here.<eos>
<bos>We're just playing catch-up with this<eol>thing. It doesn't do what you'd expect.<eos>
<bos>And, uh... Well, we got<eol>four or five hours till the moon sets.<eos>
<bos>The attacks only occur on a full moon.<eol>Then we're out of luck.<eos>
<bos>Well, I want to examine Chantara Gomez.<eos>
<bos>-  For a possible contagion?<eol>- Your contagion of fear?<eos>
<bos>- Yeah. No? - No.<eos>
<bos>Make it fast.<eol>And fill that tank up with gas.<eos>
<bos>Uh, Deputy, you're the only person<eol>that's seen this twice,<eos>
<bos>so I'd like to ride with you<eol>if you don't mind.<eos>
<bos>- Let's go. - Thanks.<eos>
<bos>You really believe me, huh?<eos>
<bos>You really believe I saw<eol>what I thought I saw?<eos>
<bos>Yeah, I believe you.<eos>
<bos>- Why? - Why do I believe you?<eos>
<bos>Yeah, I mean, what proof do you have<eol>what I'm saying is real?<eos>
<bos>I mean, it's not...<eol>it's not on the videotape.<eos>
<bos>The camera doesn't always<eol>tell the whole story.<eos>
<bos>And what about your partner?<eos>
<bos>Does she believe me?<eos>
<bos>I don't think she thinks you're lying.<eos>
<bos>Yeah, but what? Maybe I'm crazy?<eos>
<bos>I've been on the job 18 months.<eol>It's all I ever wanted to do.<eos>
<bos>Right out of the gate,<eol>I get some kind of rep like I'm crazy.<eos>
<bos>I mean, you know how cops are.<eos>
<bos>How's somebody supposed<eol>to live that down?<eos>
<bos>I don't know.<eos>
<bos>I guess just do good work.<eos>
<bos>I mean, it's a hard enough<eol>job already, you know?<eos>
<bos>You want to help people, but it's like<eol>the freakin' wild west out here.<eos>
<bos>You know people hate you?<eos>
<bos>Every shift I go out thinkin'...<eos>
<bos>Go ahead.<eos>
<bos>I go out thinkin', "You know,<eol>there is somebody out there...<eos>
<bos>"who wants to take me out.<eos>
<bos>Am I gonna run into him tonight?"<eos>
<bos>It's hard to have a fast-track career<eol>in law enforcement...<eos>
<bos>when everybody thinks you're nuts.<eos>
<bos>Tell me about it.<eos>
<bos>Chantara Gomez, age 31.<eos>
<bos>Apparent cause of death<eol>is the fracturing...<eos>
<bos>of the second and third<eol>cervical vertebrae.<eos>
<bos>There are contusions<eol>consistent with a choking...<eos>
<bos>or a throttling by very powerful hands.<eos>
<bos>People are saying her pimp killed her<eol>from beyond the grave.<eos>
<bos>That's the story going around.<eol>It's crazy, huh?<eos>
<bos>Well, let's see if we can<eol>put that story to rest, shall we?<eos>
<bos>The other thing I heard was, uh,<eos>
<bos>something about contagion.<eos>
<bos>- Like, with this body?<eos>
<bos>That's-That's completely inaccurate.<eos>
<bos>It's, uh...<eos>
<bos>The investigation is... We're moving<eol>towards an apparent chain of victims.<eos>
<bos>And I seriously doubt that<eol>we're gonna find anything...<eos>
<bos>that looks like<eol>a contagious pathology here.<eos>
<bos>Because, I mean, if we were,<eol>we should be taking precautions.<eos>
<bos>If the body could be contagious, you...<eos>
<bos>We're not even wearing masks.<eos>
<bos>Look, this is obviously a murder here.<eos>
<bos>I mean, this woman died<eol>of a broken neck, right?<eos>
<bos>Not the hantavirus.<eos>
<bos>- Who said anything about the hantavirus?<eol>- Nobody.<eos>
<bos>I just... I was, um...<eol>It was a figure of speech.<eos>
<bos>The reason I ask is,<eol>why is it so urgent...<eos>
<bos>to do an autopsy at 3:00 in the morning?<eos>
<bos>I mean, that kind of rush.<eol>It's just unheard of.<eos>
<bos>We are trying to look for the killer.<eos>
<bos>We got murder victims<eol>stacked three deep in the freezer.<eos>
<bos>Plus, you got this camera crew<eol>recording everything. Why?<eos>
<bos>Because the F.B.I. has nothing to hide.<eos>
<bos>Look, there is no ulterior motive here.<eos>
<bos>It's...<eos>
<bos>Are you gonna help me out here or what?<eos>
<bos>Yeah, of course.<eos>
<bos>Thank you.<eos>
<bos>Why did you mention the hantavirus?<eos>
<bos>- Look, I...<eos>
<bos>Oh, my God.<eos>
<bos>- Call 911. Call 911!<eos>
<bos>911! Get out of here! Come on!<eos>
<bos>It's not the hantavirus.<eos>
<bos>It looks for all the world<eol>like the hantavirus,<eos>
<bos>but I can promise you that it's not.<eos>
<bos>Well, I mean, she exhibited<eol>all the symptoms...<eos>
<bos>the hemorrhagic fever,<eol>the severe chills, acute shock...<eos>
<bos>I mean, the thing is that they all<eol>developed in a matter of seconds.<eos>
<bos>And the hantavirus<eol>doesn't kill that fast.<eos>
<bos>I mean, no virus in the world<eol>kills that fast.<eos>
<bos>You were talking about the hantavirus<eol>right before she died?<eos>
<bos>- Why? - Because she kept bringing it up.<eos>
<bos>I mean, it was like<eol>the power of suggestion, Mulder.<eos>
<bos>She was standing there. She was saying<eol>that she was afraid of contagion.<eos>
<bos>And then all of a sudden, she just...<eos>
<bos>She was afraid. She was afraid,<eos>
<bos>and her fear killed her in the worst<eol>possible way that she could imagine.<eos>
<bos>- And what do you mean by that?<eol>- It's the same.<eos>
<bos>It's the same M.O., what we've been<eol>looking for all night.<eos>
<bos>No, Mulder. I was standing right here.<eos>
<bos>I didn't see anything.<eol>They didn't see anything.<eos>
<bos>Yeah, but you weren't afraid.<eos>
<bos>The hell I wasn't afraid.<eol>I don't know what's going on here.<eos>
<bos>No, you weren't afraid for your life.<eos>
<bos>Neither were Steve and Edy,<eol>and it left them alone.<eos>
<bos>Mortal fear. I think<eol>that's what it comes down to.<eos>
<bos>This thing, whatever it is,<eol>is attracted to that.<eos>
<bos>Everybody who was attacked<eol>felt that intensely.<eos>
<bos>- For  sakes.<eol>- No, no, no. It makes perfect sense.<eos>
<bos>You asked me earlier, "What would<eol>this thing be doing in Willow Park?"<eos>
<bos>Well, where else would it go<eol>but a high-crime neighborhood?<eos>
<bos>- Where's Deputy Wetzel?<eol>- Back on patrol.<eos>
<bos>Mulder, you were... you were walking<eol>around with him for three hours.<eos>
<bos>- You didn't see anything?<eol>- No, no. But I was with him.<eos>
<bos>I was backing him up.<eos>
<bos>Like I said,<eol>there's something about a full moon.<eos>
<bos>Things definitely get strange.<eos>
<bos>Well, we checked everyplace else tonight.<eos>
<bos>Let's check this place again.<eos>
<bos>Aw! Come on.<eos>
<bos>God...<eos>
<bos>- I'm callin' for backup.<eos>
<bos>Get out! Get out now! Get out!<eos>
<bos>- It won't open!<eol>- Let's go! I got it! I got it!<eos>
<bos>- Come on! I can't open it! - Oh, God!<eos>
<bos>Oh...<eos>
<bos>That's Wetzel's car.<eos>
<bos>- Wetzel! - Get the battering ram.<eos>
<bos>Let's go around back.<eos>
<bos>That gun's not gonna do ya any good.<eos>
<bos>That's the battering ram.<eos>
<bos>Well, how come they're not in yet?<eos>
<bos>- Wind? - If you say so.<eos>
<bos>- I wonder who's in there.<eos>
<bos>Damn!<eos>
<bos>- I hate you guys. - Where's Wetzel?<eos>
<bos>We don't know.<eol>There's something out there.<eos>
<bos>- Stay where you are. -  yeah!<eos>
<bos>Look at this. Scully.<eos>
<bos>- Deputy Wetzel? -  Scully!<eos>
<bos>Have you found him?<eos>
<bos>Wetzel?<eos>
<bos>- Wetzel?<eos>
<bos>- Wetzel!<eos>
<bos>- Wetzel! - Help me! Please help me!<eos>
<bos>Wetzel, don't be afraid!<eos>
<bos>- It can't hurt you! Don't be afraid!<eos>
<bos>- That's what it wants! Look... Wetzel!<eol>- Help me!<eos>
<bos>It can't hurt you! You're a<eol>sheriff s deputy, Wetzel!<eos>
<bos>Don't be afraid now! You're on<eol>national television, so cowboy up!<eos>
<bos>Jeez!<eos>
<bos>Wetzel.<eos>
<bos>He's alive.<eos>
<bos>-  Deputy Wetzel!<eos>
<bos>We're up here!<eos>
<bos>What happened?<eos>
<bos>The sun just came up.<eos>
<bos>Hang in there, kid.<eos>
<bos>Do you think the deputy<eol>stopped it, whatever it was?<eos>
<bos>Maybe it just went away<eol>until the next full moon.<eos>
<bos>I don't know. You gotta figure<eol>there's enough fear in the world...<eos>
<bos>that if it doesn't show up in Willow<eol>Park, it's gonna show up someplace else.<eos>
<bos>You didn't get the proof<eol>that you wanted, Mulder.<eos>
<bos>Well, hey, it all depends<eol>on how they edit it together.<eos>
<bos>This is gonna be a hard one to write up.<eos>
<bos>132 at Bush. I've got him at gunpoint.<eos>
<bos>Okay, gunpoint.<eol>132 and Bush. Cover's code three.<eos>
