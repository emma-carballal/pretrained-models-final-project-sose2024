<bos>They said the birds refused to sing...<eos>
<bos>and the thermometer fell suddenly,<eos>
<bos>as if God himself<eol>had his breath stolen away.<eos>
<bos>No one there dared speak aloud,<eos>
<bos>as much in shame as in sorrow.<eos>
<bos>They uncovered the bodies one by one.<eos>
<bos>The eyes of the dead were closed,<eos>
<bos>as if waiting for permission<eol>to open them.<eos>
<bos>Were they still dreaming<eol>of ice cream and monkey bars,<eos>
<bos>of birthday cake and<eol>no future but the afternoon?<eos>
<bos>Or had their innocence been<eol>taken along with their lives,<eos>
<bos>buried in the cold earth so long ago?<eos>
<bos>These fates seemed too cruel,<eol>even for God to allow.<eos>
<bos>Or are the tragic young born again<eol>when the world's not looking?<eos>
<bos>I wanna believe so badly<eol>in a truth beyond our own,<eos>
<bos>hidden and obscured from all<eol>but the most sensitive eyes.<eos>
<bos>In the endless procession of souls,<eos>
<bos>in what cannot and will not be destroyed,<eos>
<bos>I want to believe we are unaware of<eol>God's eternal recompense and sadness...<eos>
<bos>that we cannot see his truth.<eos>
<bos>That that which is born still lives<eol>and cannot be buried in the cold earth,<eos>
<bos>but only waits to be born again<eol>at God's behest...<eos>
<bos>where in ancient starlight we lay...<eos>
<bos>in repose.<eos>
<bos>Ed Truelove was 19 when<eol>he committed his first murder.<eos>
<bos>He was working as a janitor<eol>at an elementary school...<eos>
<bos>and they needed someone<eol>to play Santa Claus.<eos>
<bos>He never got over<eol>the feelings it aroused.<eos>
<bos>He's admitted to all of it, Mulder...<eos>
<bos>24 separate murders.<eos>
<bos>But he refuses to take blame<eol>for Amber Lynn LaPierre.<eos>
<bos>I was just handed the<eol>preliminary forensics report.<eos>
<bos>Her body was not one of<eol>those found in the graves.<eos>
<bos>Mulder, I know you wanted<eol>to find her out there.<eos>
<bos>He's got hours of video of her.<eos>
<bos>I'm talking about your sister.<eos>
<bos>- I know that's who you're looking for.<eol>- Yeah.<eos>
<bos>You don't know how badly I wanted her<eol>to be in one of those graves.<eos>
<bos>I guess I just want it to be over.<eos>
<bos>-  Agent Mulder, Scully.<eos>
<bos>There's a Mr. Harold Piller<eol>here to see you.<eos>
<bos>- Mr. Piller? - Agent Mulder.<eos>
<bos>- Agent Scully. - Do we know each other?<eos>
<bos>Not personally, no. But I'm happy<eol>to meet you. Hi. Harold Piller.<eos>
<bos>Mr. Piller, are you part<eol>of this investigation?<eos>
<bos>Yes, I hope to be.<eos>
<bos>- How can we help you?<eol>- I was hoping to help you.<eos>
<bos>You're a police psychic.<eos>
<bos>My references are on the back.<eos>
<bos>I've gotten some strong<eol>hits off this case.<eos>
<bos>You're looking for a little girl,<eos>
<bos>but she's not among the dead.<eos>
<bos>Your suspect is going<eol>to say he didn't kill her.<eos>
<bos>Did he?<eos>
<bos>No. I think I can help find her.<eos>
<bos>Mr. Piller, you have<eol>some interesting references here.<eos>
<bos>You've worked with law enforcements<eol>in Kashmir, India, Myanmar,<eos>
<bos>Afghanistan, Pakistan, Khyber Pass.<eos>
<bos>That was a train wreck...<eol>a horrible tragedy.<eos>
<bos>They called me in to locate the bodies<eol>of seven children who were unrecovered.<eos>
<bos>- And did you recover them?<eol>- I didn't recover them, no.<eos>
<bos>- But I explained what happened.<eol>- What happened?<eos>
<bos>The children's bodies were transported<eol>from the accident site...<eos>
<bos>by a spiritual intervention,<eol>what are known as walk-ins.<eos>
<bos>Thank you, Mr. Piller,<eol>but we have real work to be done.<eos>
<bos>I've studied this phenomenon<eol>the world over...<eos>
<bos>at mud slides in Peru,<eol>earthquakes in Uzbekistan.<eos>
<bos>Kids' bodies never found,<eol>never accounted for in any other way.<eos>
<bos>What happened to them?<eos>
<bos>The bodies were transported<eol>from the various sites...<eos>
<bos>in starlight.<eos>
<bos>Please excuse us. Mulder?<eos>
<bos>- Mulder, please. - What is it?<eos>
<bos>Mulder, you have been through<eol>so much in such a short time...<eos>
<bos>You're vulnerable right now.<eos>
<bos>But this man isn't gonna<eol>help us find her, by his own admission.<eos>
<bos>It's not the first time<eol>I've heard what he's saying...<eos>
<bos>about the intervention<eol>of these walking spirits.<eos>
<bos>Kathy Lee Tencate mentioned<eol>it to me in the prison.<eos>
<bos>- She said that's who took her son.<eol>- Because it's foolproof, Mulder.<eos>
<bos>Nobody is gonna disprove it<eol>if there's no body.<eos>
<bos>And that's exactly what this man does.<eos>
<bos>He gives a comforting<eol>explanation at a train wreck...<eos>
<bos>or an earthquake<eol>that everyone can live with.<eos>
<bos>But the fact is<eol>the bodies are still buried.<eos>
<bos>Or maybe they are somewhere else.<eos>
<bos>Like your sister?<eos>
<bos>Mulder,<eos>
<bos>you told me that all you wanted<eol>was for this to be over.<eos>
<bos>I do.<eos>
<bos>I do.<eos>
<bos>Well, then I'm going back to Washington.<eos>
<bos>There's nothing more to be done here.<eos>
<bos>How long have you been doing this?<eos>
<bos>A few years.<eos>
<bos>I have a son who disappeared<eol>under strange circumstances.<eos>
<bos>He's never been found.<eos>
<bos>And then one day, I just...<eol>started to see them.<eos>
<bos>These walk-ins, you say they...<eos>
<bos>they come and take the children.<eos>
<bos>- Why? - In almost every case,<eos>
<bos>the parents had a precognitive image...<eos>
<bos>of their child dead.<eos>
<bos>Horrible visions.<eos>
<bos>I believe what this is<eol>is the work of good spirits...<eos>
<bos>foretelling their fates.<eos>
<bos>A fate the child was about to meet,<eos>
<bos>a particularly violent fate<eol>that wasn't meant to be.<eos>
<bos>Which is why the spirits intervened,<eos>
<bos>transforming matter into pure energy.<eos>
<bos>Starlight.<eos>
<bos>But it's not what happened here.<eos>
<bos>How do you know that?<eos>
<bos>Because these children<eol>all died suffering,<eos>
<bos>pleading innocently for their lives.<eos>
<bos>These beautiful children,<eol>so... trusting and pure.<eos>
<bos>I see them.<eos>
<bos>My God, why?<eos>
<bos>Why must some suffer and not others?<eos>
<bos>You see them?<eol>Do you see Amber Lynn LaPierre?<eos>
<bos>She wasn't here. She never was.<eos>
<bos>But I'm... I'm sensing<eol>a connection with her...<eos>
<bos>to this place.<eos>
<bos>No, it's a connection to...<eos>
<bos>- It's a connection to you. - How's that?<eos>
<bos>You lost someone close to you.<eos>
<bos>Ayoung girl.<eos>
<bos>It happened a... a long time ago.<eos>
<bos>Your sister.<eos>
<bos>There's a connection<eol>between these girls, isn't there?<eos>
<bos>Between her and Amber Lynn?<eos>
<bos>What is the connection?<eos>
<bos>I don't know.<eos>
<bos>But we're going to find them.<eol>I'm sure of it.<eos>
<bos>I'm going to count backwards now, Fox.<eos>
<bos>And you'll fall into<eol>a deep relaxed state...<eos>
<bos>so that you'll remember all about<eol>your sister and what happened.<eos>
<bos>One hundred, ninety-nine,<eos>
<bos>ninety-eight,<eos>
<bos>ninety-seven,<eos>
<bos>ninety-six...<eos>
<bos>Where are you now, Fox?<eos>
<bos>I'm at home... my mom and dad's.<eos>
<bos>We're in the den playing a game.<eos>
<bos>Who are you there with?<eos>
<bos>Samantha.<eos>
<bos>- Do you feel in any danger? - No.<eos>
<bos>Pieces on the board are fallin' off...<eos>
<bos>Here I became suspicious.<eos>
<bos>-  Samantha? - Suspicious of what?<eos>
<bos>In 30 years with the F.B.I.,<eol>you think you've seen it all.<eos>
<bos>I sometimes think I have.<eos>
<bos>But this is just a garden variety<eol>compensatory abduction fantasy.<eos>
<bos>Compensatory for what?<eos>
<bos>His guilt. His fear.<eos>
<bos>Everything that's preventing<eol>Agent Mulder...<eos>
<bos>from remembering the truth about<eol>what really happened that night.<eos>
<bos>You mean his sister wasn't abducted?<eos>
<bos>No, his sister definitely went missing<eol>in 1973. That's not in dispute.<eos>
<bos>Agent Mulder, however,<eol>wasn't regressed until 1989.<eos>
<bos>See, his delusion is playing<eol>into his unconscious hope...<eos>
<bos>that his sister is still alive.<eos>
<bos>And if you think about it,<eol>his delusion has the effect...<eos>
<bos>of giving him reason to pursue her.<eos>
<bos>But why alien abduction?<eos>
<bos>Close Encounters, E. T., who knows?<eos>
<bos>But there was probably a lot of imagery<eol>collecting in his head...<eos>
<bos>in those 16 years.<eos>
<bos>And then he comes down here,<eol>and he finds the X-Files.<eos>
<bos>So what do you think<eol>happened to his sister?<eos>
<bos>Well, in 1973...<eos>
<bos>we were pretty damned unsophisticated<eol>about violent predatory crime.<eos>
<bos>My guess is she was<eol>kidnapped in the house,<eos>
<bos>her body was disposed of, never found.<eos>
<bos>You think that his sister's dead?<eos>
<bos>Have you seen this file?<eos>
<bos>There was an extraordinary amount<eol>of effort put into finding his sister.<eos>
<bos>Even the treasury department<eol>got involved.<eos>
<bos>His father worked at a high level<eol>in the government.<eos>
<bos>They found nothing.<eos>
<bos>Why, Agent Scully? Why do you<eol>wanna bring all this back up now?<eos>
<bos>Someone owes it to Mulder.<eos>
<bos>Word of advice, me to you.<eos>
<bos>Let it be.<eos>
<bos>You know, there are some wounds that are<eol>just too painful ever to be reopened.<eos>
<bos>Well, this particular wound<eol>has never healed.<eos>
<bos>And Mulder deserves closure,<eol>just like anyone.<eos>
<bos>Apes evolved from men?<eos>
<bos>- There's gotta be an answer.<eol>- Don't look for it, Taylor.<eos>
<bos>You may not like what you find.<eos>
<bos>Untie me!<eos>
<bos>- What? What are you doing?<eol>- I'm picking up something.<eos>
<bos>- It's 3:00 in the morning.<eol>- There's someone here.<eos>
<bos>- Yeah, the TV is on... - No. A visitor.<eos>
<bos>They... They wanna speak.<eol>They wanna tell us something.<eos>
<bos>What?<eos>
<bos>Get a piece of paper.<eos>
<bos>- And a pen.<eos>
<bos>No, you.<eos>
<bos>Shoot.<eos>
<bos>It's your mother.<eos>
<bos>She's here in the room with us.<eos>
<bos>She's trying to speak to you.<eos>
<bos>What does she say?<eos>
<bos>She wants to tell you<eol>about your sister...<eos>
<bos>- Where she is.<eos>
<bos>What is she saying?<eos>
<bos>Harold?<eos>
<bos>I don't know. I...<eos>
<bos>-  She's gone. - Come on, Harold.<eos>
<bos>I lost her.<eos>
<bos>- That's crap. You're full of crap. - No.<eos>
<bos>- Get out of here. - I'm telling you...<eos>
<bos>- She had a message. - Please go.<eos>
<bos>Look!<eos>
<bos>Who wrote that?<eos>
<bos>You did.<eos>
<bos>- Mulder. -  Mulder, it's me.<eos>
<bos>I found something, and I'm standing here<eol>not quite believing what it is.<eos>
<bos>- What is it?<eol>- I don't know if you know this,<eos>
<bos>In 1973. I know all about that.<eos>
<bos>A document that matches one that I found<eol>in the treasury investigation file.<eos>
<bos>But she had the original, Mulder.<eos>
<bos>I don't see where<eol>you're goin' with this, Scully.<eos>
<bos>And it's signed with<eol>the initials "C.G.B.S."<eos>
<bos>C.G.B. Spender...<eos>
<bos>the Smoking Man.<eos>
<bos>He was involved with this back in '73.<eos>
<bos>That's not exactly a revelation,<eol>Scully. He was a friend of my father's.<eos>
<bos>Mulder, you told me you believed that<eol>he's the man that killed your father,<eos>
<bos>that he's the man who's<eol>done nothing but confound your work,<eos>
<bos>who's come close to killing you.<eos>
<bos>And here he's ordering people<eol>to stop looking for your sister.<eos>
<bos>- You don't wanna press him?<eol>- It's a dead end.<eos>
<bos>He's never been of any help,<eol>and he's not gonna be of any help now.<eos>
<bos>Look, I'm pursuing this my own way,<eol>all right. I gotta go.<eos>
<bos>It's not exactly the end<eol>of the rainbow, is it, Harold?<eos>
<bos>There's something here.<eol>I'm getting a strong sense of it.<eos>
<bos>I think we should have a look.<eos>
<bos>I've had a look.<eos>
<bos>What are you afraid of?<eol>That you'll really find her?<eos>
<bos>- That you'd have to deal with it?<eol>- There's nothing here.<eos>
<bos>- It's a decommissioned base.<eol>- You wrote the name down yourself.<eos>
<bos>Why do you care so much about what I<eol>feel? Why is this so important to you?<eos>
<bos>You gentlemen need to move along.<eos>
<bos>I have to ask you to turn around<eol>and get back in your car.<eos>
<bos>There's nothing to see here.<eos>
<bos>There is something here to see,<eol>Agent Mulder. I'm sure of it.<eos>
<bos>- Hello?<eos>
<bos>I should have grabbed it for you.<eos>
<bos>I like to make myself useful.<eos>
<bos>You can start by putting<eol>out that cigarette.<eos>
<bos>You've got it all figured out,<eol>don't you, Agent Scully?<eos>
<bos>All but why you can't<eol>just come to the door and knock.<eos>
<bos>I did that.<eos>
<bos>No one answered.<eos>
<bos>You're sick.<eos>
<bos>I had an operation.<eos>
<bos>What do you want?<eos>
<bos>I want you to stop looking.<eos>
<bos>You've wanted that since 1973...<eos>
<bos>when you ordered an end to the search<eol>for Agent Mulder's sister.<eos>
<bos>Your initials are on that document.<eos>
<bos>Yes, I signed that order,<eos>
<bos>because I knew then what I know now...<eol>no one's gonna find her.<eos>
<bos>- Why not?<eol>- Because I believe she's dead.<eos>
<bos>No reason to believe otherwise.<eos>
<bos>You're a liar.<eos>
<bos>There was so much to protect before.<eol>It's all gone now.<eos>
<bos>So you just let Mulder believe<eol>that she was alive for all these years?<eos>
<bos>Out of kindness, Agent Scully.<eos>
<bos>Allow him his ignorance.<eos>
<bos>It's what gives him hope.<eos>
<bos>- My sister was here? - Yes.<eos>
<bos>One of these houses? Where?<eos>
<bos>I've lost it, whatever it was.<eos>
<bos>Which house, Harold?<eol>Come on. Which house?<eos>
<bos>Let's go, Harold.<eos>
<bos>You were right. This was the house.<eos>
<bos>- How do you know? - Look.<eos>
<bos>I told you! What did I tell you?<eos>
<bos>You told me she was here.<eos>
<bos>You didn't say with who.<eos>
<bos>When did you come up<eol>with this story, Mulder?<eos>
<bos>After her abduction,<eol>she was returned to him...<eos>
<bos>and he raised her at the military base,<eol>along with his son Jeffrey Spender.<eos>
<bos>- Mulder...<eol>- Scully, I saw her name in the cement.<eos>
<bos>Her handprints right next to his.<eos>
<bos>Mulder, I spoke to him...<eos>
<bos>the Smoking Man, C.G.B. Spender,<eol>whatever his name is.<eos>
<bos>You went to him?<eos>
<bos>He told me that she was dead.<eos>
<bos>Well, he's a liar.<eos>
<bos>Mulder, why would he lie now?<eol>I mean, think about it.<eos>
<bos>It hurts me to tell you this.<eos>
<bos>The handprints prove he's a liar!<eol>I saw her handprints in the cement.<eos>
<bos>Her name "Samantha" right underneath<eol>them. How more obvious can it be?<eos>
<bos>Harold Piller led me there.<eol>He led me right to 'em.<eos>
<bos>Oh, he led you, Mulder.<eos>
<bos>He led you from the moment<eol>that he met you.<eos>
<bos>- Something wrong?<eos>
<bos>Sit down, Harold.<eos>
<bos>Hi.<eos>
<bos>You're back.<eos>
<bos>- What?<eol>- That you're currently the subject...<eos>
<bos>of a criminal investigation<eol>into the murder of your son.<eos>
<bos>My son was taken from me.<eol>The police need someone to blame.<eos>
<bos>That's not all, Harold.<eol>Your history of mental illness.<eos>
<bos>You wouldn't have believed me<eol>if I had told you any of that.<eos>
<bos>- Look what I've shown you.<eol>- You only tell me what you see.<eos>
<bos>I came to you because I wanna help.<eos>
<bos>You think I'm a fraud?<eol>What do I have to gain from this?<eos>
<bos>How am I any different from you?<eos>
<bos>All I want is to find my son.<eol>I... I just...<eos>
<bos>I just want my little boy back.<eos>
<bos>I see these things. I don't know how,<eol>but... there has got to be a reason.<eos>
<bos>And if it's not to help, what is it?<eos>
<bos>I know your sister is out there.<eos>
<bos>Maybe I can prove it to you.<eos>
<bos>Whoever's lived here<eol>hasn't lived here in a long time.<eos>
<bos>- We're gonna need to hold hands.<eol>- What do you mean?<eos>
<bos>I'm going to try and summon<eol>their presence into the house.<eos>
<bos>Oh, yea. A seance. I haven't<eol>done that since high school.<eos>
<bos>Maybe afterwards we can play<eol>"postman" and "spin the bottle."<eos>
<bos>I'm not going to say anything.<eos>
<bos>I'm just going to be very quiet and<eol>still. That's how it seems to work best.<eos>
<bos>Um, you might experience<eol>a sudden chill...<eos>
<bos>or feel a pressure in your ears.<eos>
<bos>That means they're here.<eos>
<bos>And if they need to,<eol>they'll let themselves be seen.<eos>
<bos>Close your eyes...<eos>
<bos>and let them come to you.<eos>
<bos>They will come to you<eol>if you're ready to see.<eos>
<bos>- How will we know? - Shh.<eos>
<bos>Stay quiet. You'll know.<eos>
<bos>Mulder?<eos>
<bos>- What are you doing? - It's here.<eos>
<bos>What is?<eos>
<bos>There was a boy.<eol>He led me into this room.<eos>
<bos>Mulder?<eos>
<bos>It's a diary.<eos>
<bos>It's your sister's.<eos>
<bos>"They did more tests today,<eol>but not the horrible kind.<eos>
<bos>"I was awake and they<eol>made me lay still...<eos>
<bos>"while they shine lights in my eyes.<eos>
<bos>"They asked me questions,<eol>but I always lie now...<eos>
<bos>"and tell them what they wanna hear<eol>just to make 'em stop.<eos>
<bos>"I hate them and I hate<eol>the way they treat me,<eos>
<bos>They know I hate them,<eol>but they... don't even care."<eos>
<bos>This is 1979.<eos>
<bos>She's 14 years old here.<eos>
<bos>Fourteen years old.<eos>
<bos>"I remember faces.<eol>I think I had a brother...<eos>
<bos>"with brown hair who used to tease me.<eos>
<bos>"I hope...<eos>
<bos>someday he reads this and knows<eol>I wish I could see his face for real."<eos>
<bos>And then, uh,<eos>
<bos>she's, uh, talking about running away.<eos>
<bos>She wants to run away...<eos>
<bos>so that they stop doing the tests.<eos>
<bos>And then it just stops.<eos>
<bos>Let's get out of here.<eos>
<bos>You know, I never stop to think...<eos>
<bos>that the light is billions<eol>of years old by the time we see it.<eos>
<bos>From the beginning of time...<eos>
<bos>right past us into the future.<eos>
<bos>Nothing is ancient in the universe.<eos>
<bos>Maybe they are souls, Scully...<eos>
<bos>travel through time and starlight...<eos>
<bos>Iooking for homes.<eos>
<bos>I wonder what my mother saw.<eos>
<bos>I wonder what she was trying to tell me.<eos>
<bos>Get some sleep.<eos>
<bos>All right.<eos>
<bos>I got it, Mulder.<eol>I couldn't believe it when I saw it.<eos>
<bos>It was like it was looking for me.<eos>
<bos>- Sergeant's blotter, 1979.<eol>- What are you talking about?<eos>
<bos>The description matches your sister.<eos>
<bos>- When did you find this?<eol>- Mulder, it's almost noon.<eos>
<bos>Maybe she went by another name.<eos>
<bos>She could have given them<eol>a name other than her own.<eos>
<bos>She didn't give a name at all.<eos>
<bos>Read this. It's a medical report.<eos>
<bos>Admittance notes say the E.R. nurses<eol>couldn't get her name out of her.<eos>
<bos>Neither could the cops.<eos>
<bos>Her medical examination is normal.<eos>
<bos>Her mental state...<eos>
<bos>it says here she was exhibiting<eol>signs of paranoia.<eos>
<bos>Evidence of probable<eol>self-inflicted abuse,<eos>
<bos>including small crescent-shaped scars<eol>on her knees, wrists and chest.<eos>
<bos>Those are from the tests, Scully.<eos>
<bos>That's her. She was here.<eos>
<bos>Fourteen years old in this hospital.<eos>
<bos>"Diagnosis of condition incomplete.<eol>Tests unavailable."<eos>
<bos>And he knew.<eos>
<bos>He lied. He knew she was alive.<eos>
<bos>And the only reason he's lying now<eol>is because she's still alive.<eos>
<bos>Mulder, wait.<eos>
<bos>I know. You don't want me to get<eol>my hopes up. I understand that.<eos>
<bos>That was 1979. It was 21 years ago.<eos>
<bos>We have an E.R. nurse who signed her in.<eos>
<bos>What's wrong?<eos>
<bos>I have this powerful feeling,<eol>and I can't explain it,<eos>
<bos>but that... this is the end of the road.<eos>
<bos>That I've been brought here<eol>to learn the truth.<eos>
<bos>Are you ready for it?<eos>
<bos>Do you want me to go talk to her myself?<eos>
<bos>Okay.<eos>
<bos>Oh. I thought that was the door.<eos>
<bos>- Arbutus Ray? - Yes.<eos>
<bos>Are you the same Arbutus Ray<eol>that worked as a nurse...<eos>
<bos>at the Dominic Savio<eol>Memorial Hospital in 1979?<eos>
<bos>Yes, I'm she.<eos>
<bos>I'd like to ask you about<eol>a patient you treated...<eos>
<bos>a 14-year-old girl.<eos>
<bos>I remember. Yes.<eos>
<bos>She was such a pretty young girl.<eos>
<bos>You couldn't forget someone like her,<eol>or how frightened she was.<eos>
<bos>Scared for her sweet life.<eos>
<bos>The deputy brought her in.<eol>She was shaking like a leaf.<eos>
<bos>Wouldn't let anyone touch her but me.<eos>
<bos>Then the strangest thing happened.<eos>
<bos>You had a vision of her... dead.<eos>
<bos>Like the parents of Amber Lynn LaPierre.<eos>
<bos>No one believed me.<eos>
<bos>Honestly, you're the first person who...<eos>
<bos>- So you saw her dead?<eol>- That night in her bed.<eos>
<bos>I blinked and it was gone.<eos>
<bos>She was sleeping as sound as could be.<eos>
<bos>I don't know why, but...<eos>
<bos>it made some kind of strange sense.<eos>
<bos>What do you mean?<eos>
<bos>There were men.<eos>
<bos>They came to pick her up late that night.<eos>
<bos>I assumed the one<eol>was her father, but he...<eos>
<bos>he gave me such a chill<eol>when he looked at me...<eos>
<bos>when I asked him would he please<eol>put out his cigarette.<eos>
<bos>So, they took her?<eos>
<bos>They meant to.<eos>
<bos>But when I took them to her room,<eos>
<bos>she was gone.<eos>
<bos>Disappeared out of a locked room.<eos>
<bos>Just vanished.<eos>
<bos>Samantha.<eos>
<bos>Mulder, where'd you go?<eos>
<bos>End of the road.<eos>
<bos>He's okay. It's okay.<eos>
<bos>My son? You saw my son?<eos>
<bos>He's dead. They're all dead, Harold...<eos>
<bos>your son, Amber Lynn, my sister.<eos>
<bos>- No. - Harold.<eos>
<bos>You see so much,<eol>but you refuse to see him.<eos>
<bos>You refuse to let him go.<eos>
<bos>But you have to let him go now, Harold.<eos>
<bos>He's protected. He's in a better place.<eol>They're all in a better place.<eos>
<bos>We both have to let go, Harold.<eos>
<bos>You're wrong. I'm going to find him.<eos>
<bos>I don't believe you!<eos>
<bos>Mulder, what happened?<eos>
<bos>Are you sure you're all right?<eos>
<bos>I'm fine.<eos>
<bos>I'm free.<eos>
