<bos>We've exhausted all medical<eol>and scientific evidence.<eos>
<bos>The brute fact is he's experiencing<eol>so much activity in his temporal lobe...<eos>
<bos>that it is effectively<eol>destroying his brain.<eos>
<bos>Enough!<eos>
<bos>There's only so much bluntness<eol>a mother can take.<eos>
<bos>- Sorry. I just...<eol>- All you do is sedate him.<eos>
<bos>You're turning him...<eos>
<bos>into a zombie.<eos>
<bos>I know you can hear me, Fox.<eos>
<bos>- Can you give me a sign?<eol>-  I can hear you, Mom.<eos>
<bos>Fox?<eos>
<bos>Mom, I can hear you.<eos>
<bos>I'm here.<eos>
<bos>I love you, my darling boy.<eos>
<bos>Mom, where you going?<eos>
<bos>Mom? Mom?<eos>
<bos>Come back, Mom!<eos>
<bos>Mom!<eos>
<bos>Mom!<eos>
<bos>Mom!<eos>
<bos>When in disgrace<eol>with fortune in men's eyes.<eos>
<bos>Ah, but your mommy will still love you.<eos>
<bos>All a mother wants is to...<eos>
<bos>shield her boy from pain and danger.<eos>
<bos>Safe in the world<eol>as he was once in the womb.<eos>
<bos>But maybe we think a father<eol>demands more than mere survival.<eos>
<bos>Maybe we're afraid a father demands<eol>worldly adulation.<eos>
<bos>Success, heroism.<eos>
<bos>I know you can hear me.<eos>
<bos>I can always hear you.<eos>
<bos>Even when my mind is jammed<eol>with a thousand voices,<eos>
<bos>I can hear you like a snake<eol>hissing underneath.<eos>
<bos>How the hell did you get in here?<eos>
<bos>How does anything I do surprise you now?<eos>
<bos>Aren't you expecting me<eol>to sprout vampire fangs?<eos>
<bos>You've come to kill me.<eos>
<bos>It'd be better than living<eol>like a zombie, wouldn't it?<eos>
<bos>I'm giving you a choice.<eos>
<bos>- What choice? - Life or death.<eos>
<bos>Your account is squared<eol>with me, with God,<eos>
<bos>with the I.R.S., with the F.B.I.<eos>
<bos>Rise out of your bed and come with me.<eos>
<bos>I'm dying, you idiot.<eos>
<bos>If I could get up, I'd kick your ass.<eos>
<bos>Don't be so dramatic.<eol>Only part of you is dying...<eos>
<bos>the part that played the hero.<eos>
<bos>You suffered enough...<eos>
<bos>for the X-Files, for your partner,<eos>
<bos>for the world.<eos>
<bos>You're not Christ.<eos>
<bos>You're not Prince Hamlet.<eos>
<bos>You're not even Ralph Nader.<eos>
<bos>You can walk out of this hospital<eol>and the world will forget you.<eos>
<bos>Arise.<eos>
<bos>What... What the hell<eol>are you doing to me?<eos>
<bos>I'm showing you how to take<eol>the road not taken.<eos>
<bos>Take my hand.<eos>
<bos>- Why should I take your hand?<eol>- You can't read my mind?<eos>
<bos>No. I can't.<eos>
<bos>- All the voices are gone.<eol>- Take my hand, Fox.<eos>
<bos>You have to take the first step.<eos>
<bos>Take my hand.<eos>
<bos>I'm your father.<eos>
<bos>Sleep is a luxury, Agent Scully.<eol>A self-indulgence we have no time for.<eos>
<bos>- Nor does Agent Mulder.<eol>- How did you get in here?<eos>
<bos>Getting in is easy.<eos>
<bos>It's what you do once<eol>you're inside that's key.<eos>
<bos>- I need you to use it wisely.<eol>- Like you?<eos>
<bos>It's what Agent Mulder wanted.<eol>He knows what's wrong.<eos>
<bos>What he wants now is to prove it.<eol>It's why he asked for me, not you.<eos>
<bos>I don't believe that.<eos>
<bos>Two years ago your partner was infected<eol>with a virus he claimed was alien.<eos>
<bos>A virus reactivated in him by exposure<eol>to a source of energy, also alien.<eos>
<bos>Agent Mulder is living proof of what<eol>he tried so long to substantiate...<eos>
<bos>the existence of alien life.<eos>
<bos>But whatever it is, it's killing him.<eos>
<bos>And we have to get it out of him.<eos>
<bos>You destroy this and I'll destroy you.<eos>
<bos>- What happened?<eol>- Mulder's gone. He's disappeared.<eos>
<bos>- I know, I know. - How did this happen?<eos>
<bos>- His mother checked him out.<eol>- His mother?<eos>
<bos>- That's what they're saying.<eol>- Has anybody spoken with her?<eos>
<bos>Sir, this isn't just a case. This is<eol>Agent Mulder we're speaking about.<eos>
<bos>And I'm trying to help him...<eos>
<bos>by staying out of this from now on.<eos>
<bos>Sir?<eos>
<bos>I'm in a compromised position.<eos>
<bos>The less I know about Agent Mulder's<eol>whereabouts and yours,<eos>
<bos>the better.<eos>
<bos>The child is father to the man.<eos>
<bos>You've been asleep quite a while.<eos>
<bos>I suspect it'll be sometime before<eol>your sleep patterns return to normal.<eos>
<bos>Would you like an explanation?<eos>
<bos>I'm not sure.<eos>
<bos>- Why? - At some point I realized that...<eos>
<bos>if the Syndicate didn't kill you,<eol>the F.B.I. would.<eos>
<bos>If the F.B.I. didn't kill you,<eol>your own misguided heroism would.<eos>
<bos>There's really no way out for you.<eos>
<bos>There's no way for you<eol>to cheat death except by disappearing.<eos>
<bos>A man can't just disappear.<eos>
<bos>Oh, we've made entire cultures disappear.<eos>
<bos>Like me now, you'll become<eol>a man without a name.<eos>
<bos>But even while you miss<eol>your former identity,<eos>
<bos>you'll learn to love<eol>life's simpler pleasures.<eos>
<bos>Well, that'll be kind of tough<eol>with these on.<eos>
<bos>When you no longer wanna run,<eol>those will come off.<eos>
<bos>How do you feel?<eos>
<bos>I feel better than I did.<eos>
<bos>I gotta tell Scully. I gotta tell her.<eos>
<bos>If you do have contact with her,<eol>you'll put her in danger.<eos>
<bos>You're entering a kind of...<eos>
<bos>witness protection program<eol>for want of a better term.<eos>
<bos>- Can I offer you a cigarette?<eol>- I don't smoke.<eos>
<bos>Well, maybe now you do.<eos>
<bos>Don't move.<eos>
<bos>- Who's there?<eol>-  I don't mean to frighten you.<eos>
<bos>Albert Hosteen.<eos>
<bos>What are you doing here?<eol>How did you get here?<eos>
<bos>- I'm sorry to surprise you. - Surprise?<eos>
<bos>That you're standing here...<eos>
<bos>Last time I saw you was in New Mexico.<eos>
<bos>They'd taken you from the hospital.<eol>Your doctors feared the worst.<eos>
<bos>- I was hoping to see your partner.<eol>- He's missing.<eos>
<bos>You must save him.<eos>
<bos>He's very ill.<eos>
<bos>You must find him<eol>before something happens.<eos>
<bos>Not only for his sake,<eos>
<bos>for the sake of us all.<eos>
<bos>- Where are we? - Home.<eos>
<bos>This is your new life.<eos>
<bos>I don't understand.<eos>
<bos>You can drive away right now.<eos>
<bos>Drive back to Scully and your X-Files<eol>and imminent death.<eos>
<bos>I wouldn't be surprised if you did.<eos>
<bos>But I think you should<eol>take a look around.<eos>
<bos>Mulder was taken out of<eol>the hospital just before 2:00 a.m.<eos>
<bos>She checked him out A.M. A...<eol>against medical advice.<eos>
<bos>It's all legitimate<eol>until you go to surveillance.<eos>
<bos>This is a camera in the hall<eol>outside Mulder's room.<eos>
<bos>Here's inside his room.<eos>
<bos>And two other cameras on the ward.<eos>
<bos>We're guestimating there were<eol>at least three others involved.<eos>
<bos>Check this out.<eos>
<bos>Where's Waldo?<eos>
<bos>She's talking to someone.<eos>
<bos>Yeah.<eos>
<bos>I know who that is.<eos>
<bos>Hello?<eos>
<bos>Anybody home?<eos>
<bos>They can change your name,<eos>
<bos>but they can't change<eol>the things you love.<eos>
<bos>It can't be.<eos>
<bos>- You're dead. -  No.<eos>
<bos>No, just really relaxed.<eos>
<bos>Scully... saw you get shot...<eos>
<bos>on the bridge six years ago.<eos>
<bos>I was sure you were... dead.<eos>
<bos>One, uh, well-placed bullet.<eos>
<bos>A punctuation mark on a man's life and<eol>you get to start a whole new chapter.<eos>
<bos>I'm fine, son,<eos>
<bos>aside from a little tennis elbow.<eos>
<bos>I felt responsible for your death.<eos>
<bos>You can let that go. Clearly I'm alive.<eos>
<bos>I thought that you died for my quest.<eos>
<bos>Yes, along with Scully's sister and<eol>the man you thought was your father...<eos>
<bos>and Duane Barry and-and<eol>even Scully's mysterious illness...<eos>
<bos>and on and on and on.<eos>
<bos>You can let go of all that guilt.<eos>
<bos>I'm here to tell you that<eol>you're not the hub of the universe...<eos>
<bos>the cause of life and death.<eos>
<bos>We, you and I,<eos>
<bos>are merely puppets in a master plan...<eol>no more, no less.<eos>
<bos>You've suffered enough.<eos>
<bos>Now you should enjoy your life.<eos>
<bos>Let me show you something.<eos>
<bos>That's my wife and daughters.<eos>
<bos>We live just down the street.<eos>
<bos>I hope you visit us for dinner.<eos>
<bos>Oh. Oh, hey, buddy. That's okay.<eos>
<bos>You can build it again. Just start again.<eos>
<bos>Okay?<eos>
<bos>Who's there?<eos>
<bos>- Who are you?<eol>- Hundreds of little joys...<eos>
<bos>to open a door and have<eol>a woman beckon you in.<eos>
<bos>To have her make a fire<eol>and lay the table for you.<eos>
<bos>And when it's late,<eos>
<bos>to feel her take you into her arms.<eos>
<bos>This is Tina<eol>Mulder. I'm not in to take your call.<eos>
<bos>- Please leave your message.<eos>
<bos>This is Dana Scully.<eos>
<bos>Thank you. As before, you can reach<eol>me at your son's office at the F.B.I.<eos>
<bos>Thank you.<eos>
<bos>- Skinner.<eos>
<bos>Sir, did you send me this book?<eos>
<bos>- Excuse me? - This book?<eos>
<bos>It explains everything<eol>that I found in Africa,<eos>
<bos>using the same symbols<eol>that I found on the ship.<eos>
<bos>Agent Scully, I asked you<eol>not to involve me in this.<eos>
<bos>It's all here, sir.<eol>A foretelling of mass extinction.<eos>
<bos>A myth about a man who can save us<eol>from it. That's why they took Mulder.<eos>
<bos>They think that his illness is a gift...<eos>
<bos>a protection against a coming plague.<eos>
<bos>I'm sorry, Agent Scully. The assistant<eol>director has given me express orders...<eos>
<bos>- Not to let you in.<eos>
<bos>Sir, are you hurt?<eos>
<bos>Are you cut? Get on the phone.<eos>
<bos>Hey!<eos>
<bos>Stop that man!<eos>
<bos>Good morning.<eos>
<bos>- What's wrong, Fox?<eos>
<bos>There's nothing wrong. Perfect.<eos>
<bos>It's all perfect.<eol>What the hell am I doing here?<eos>
<bos>- You just need some coffee.<eol>- No, I'm... I'm serious.<eos>
<bos>I have commitments to the X-Files,<eol>to Scully, to my sister.<eos>
<bos>You think you know<eol>what that means... commitment.<eos>
<bos>- It's all just childish, Fox.<eol>- Childish?<eos>
<bos>Yes. You've been a child...<eos>
<bos>with only the responsibility of a child,<eos>
<bos>to your own dreams and fantasies.<eos>
<bos>and become a father.<eos>
<bos>Wow.<eos>
<bos>Diana, you... you lay all this on<eol>me after I sleep with you one time.<eos>
<bos>What's it gonna be like tomorrow?<eos>
<bos>- You have to let go, Fox.<eol>- Just like that?<eos>
<bos>I have every reason to believe<eol>left here to carry on his dirty work?<eos>
<bos>Hey. He lives the next block over.<eos>
<bos>We'll go visit after breakfast.<eos>
<bos>You told someone, didn't you?<eol>You let the information out.<eos>
<bos>- What are you talking about?<eol>- A man attacked Skinner in his office.<eos>
<bos>- For what?<eol>- For what he knows about Mulder.<eos>
<bos>I haven't told anyone.<eos>
<bos>What is this?<eos>
<bos>These are mine!<eos>
<bos>You've hacked into my files.<eol>What are you doing with these?<eos>
<bos>- I was having them analyzed. - By whom?<eos>
<bos>- The National Institute of Health.<eol>- What?<eos>
<bos>where did you get it?<eos>
<bos>This was not supposed to go public.<eos>
<bos>- Wherever you got it,<eos>
<bos>that data supports<eol>what's happened to Mulder.<eos>
<bos>It proves what he's become...<eol>biologically alien.<eos>
<bos>- What are you hiding?<eol>- It doesn't matter.<eos>
<bos>It matters to someone.<eos>
<bos>Whoever it is, it sounds<eol>like they're looking for Mulder too.<eos>
<bos>I wasn't expecting you so soon.<eos>
<bos>I thought you'd take<eol>a few days to settle in.<eos>
<bos>Including why you live<eol>in a bigger house than I do.<eos>
<bos>I've got quite a few mouths to feed.<eos>
<bos>Three grandkids...<eos>
<bos>and, uh, your sister.<eos>
<bos>She's been living here all along.<eos>
<bos>Living a life you'd forsaken.<eos>
<bos>He said you were coming.<eos>
<bos>A father has high hopes for his son.<eos>
<bos>The depth of his capacity for suffering.<eos>
<bos>Like father, like son.<eos>
<bos>They think what he has is killing him,<eos>
<bos>but in actuality,<eol>he's never been more alive.<eos>
<bos>- Do you think he dreams?<eol>- Oh, I'm sure he dreams.<eos>
<bos>a simpler life...<eos>
<bos>full of small pleasures.<eos>
<bos>Extraordinary men are always most<eol>tempted by the most ordinary things.<eos>
<bos>Dreams are all he has now.<eos>
<bos>- Bum a cigarette, Agent Fowley?<eol>- I don't smoke.<eos>
<bos>Really? I could swear<eol>I smell cigarette smoke on you.<eos>
<bos>- Let's cut the crap, shall we?<eol>- Yes. Let's.<eos>
<bos>Where's Mulder?<eos>
<bos>you could think about<eol>what you could have done to prevent it.<eos>
<bos>I just want you to think...<eos>
<bos>think of Mulder when you met him,<eos>
<bos>think of the promise and<eol>the life in front of him.<eos>
<bos>Think of him now.<eos>
<bos>And then try and stand there<eol>in front of me, look me in the eye...<eos>
<bos>and tell me Mulder wouldn't<eol>bust his ass trying to save you.<eos>
<bos>I'm thinking, Agent Scully.<eos>
<bos>I'm always thinking.<eos>
<bos>It's a chance none of us ever expected,<eos>
<bos>let alone hope for.<eos>
<bos>After all these years, trying to develop<eol>a compatible alien human hybrid,<eos>
<bos>to have one ready-made.<eos>
<bos>All these years, all the questioning why.<eos>
<bos>There was no way you could<eol>have predicted this.<eos>
<bos>The fact remains, he's become our savior.<eos>
<bos>He's immune to the coming<eol>viral apocalypse. He's the hero here.<eos>
<bos>He may not survive the procedure.<eos>
<bos>Then he suffers a hero's fate.<eos>
<bos>Diana?<eos>
<bos>Fox.<eos>
<bos>It's time, honey.<eos>
<bos>How you doin'?<eos>
<bos>Don't think of the man.<eos>
<bos>Think of the sacrifice he's making<eol>for all of us... for the world.<eos>
<bos>It would have been nice<eol>to give him a choice.<eos>
<bos>You don't think Mulder<eol>would have chosen this?<eos>
<bos>To become the thing<eol>he sought for so long?<eos>
<bos>To feel what it's like?<eos>
<bos>He is what he sought.<eos>
<bos>We'll never know.<eos>
<bos>Besides, his task is almost complete.<eos>
<bos>I'll carry the burden from here on in.<eos>
<bos>I know about the boy.<eos>
<bos>The boy on the beach.<eos>
<bos>The vision you go to in your mind.<eos>
<bos>We all have such places...<eos>
<bos>a point of memory and desire.<eos>
<bos>I've seen him thousands of times.<eos>
<bos>I've never seen what he wants me to see.<eos>
<bos>Close your eyes.<eos>
<bos>He's ready to show you,<eol>if you're ready to see.<eos>
<bos>Wow! What did you make?<eos>
<bos>An unidentified flying object.<eos>
<bos>Hey, what are you doing?<eol>Why are you destroying your spaceship?<eos>
<bos>It's your spaceship.<eol>You're destroying it.<eos>
<bos>You were supposed to help me.<eos>
<bos>- You're running out of time.<eos>
<bos>Why do you come to me like this?<eos>
<bos>Why, when I can't find him?<eos>
<bos>You don't look in the right place.<eos>
<bos>- I don't think you're hearing me.<eol>- You don't know where he is?<eos>
<bos>Have you looked for him...<eos>
<bos>here?<eos>
<bos>Are you asking me to pray?<eos>
<bos>There are more worlds than the one<eol>you can hold in your hand.<eos>
<bos>I hope you see the poetry in this, Diana.<eos>
<bos>You're removing genetic material<eol>that may kill your son.<eos>
<bos>We're forcing the next step<eol>in evolution to save man.<eos>
<bos>We're doing God's work, Diana.<eos>
<bos>Without this immunity,<eol>everyone would die.<eos>
<bos>This knowledge is God's blessing.<eos>
<bos>I'll carry on for Mulder from here.<eos>
<bos>The patient's come out. Mulder's awake.<eos>
<bos>-  Is he feeling any pain?<eol>-  Flat on the monitor.<eos>
<bos>Let's do this thing.<eos>
<bos>Rest now.<eos>
<bos>Can you open the blind?<eos>
<bos>I'd like to take a look outside.<eos>
<bos>I wanted you to have peace.<eos>
<bos>Where's Samantha?<eos>
<bos>Your sister died five years ago.<eos>
<bos>What about Deep Throat?<eos>
<bos>We've been over this. He's dead.<eos>
<bos>Diana's dead.<eos>
<bos>And Scully.<eos>
<bos>Scully's dead?<eos>
<bos>She's dead.<eos>
<bos>It's time for you to let go.<eos>
<bos>They're waiting for you, if you let go.<eos>
<bos>Close your eyes, Fox.<eos>
<bos>We're the last, you and I.<eos>
<bos>The end...<eos>
<bos>and the beginning.<eos>
<bos>There's nothing to be done.<eos>
<bos>Nothing at all.<eos>
<bos>Scully. I knew you'd come.<eos>
<bos>They told me you were dead.<eos>
<bos>And you believed them?<eos>
<bos>- Traitor. - What?<eos>
<bos>- Deserter. Coward. - Scully, don't.<eos>
<bos>What do you mean?<eos>
<bos>Not in a comfortable bed<eol>with the devil outside.<eos>
<bos>No, you don't understand.<eol>He's taken care of me.<eos>
<bos>No, Mulder.<eos>
<bos>He's lulled you to sleep.<eos>
<bos>He's made you trade your true mission<eol>for creature comforts.<eos>
<bos>There was no mission.<eos>
<bos>- There were no aliens. - No aliens?<eos>
<bos>Have you looked outside, Mulder?<eos>
<bos>I can't.<eos>
<bos>I'm... too tired.<eos>
<bos>No, Mulder. You must get up.<eos>
<bos>You must get up and fight.<eos>
<bos>Especially you.<eos>
<bos>This isn't your place.<eos>
<bos>Get up, Mulder.<eos>
<bos>Get up and fight the fight.<eos>
<bos>- Scully?<eos>
<bos>Scully?<eos>
<bos>Scully?<eos>
<bos>Scully?<eos>
<bos>Mulder?<eos>
<bos>Mulder, you've got to wake up.<eos>
<bos>I've got to get you out of here.<eos>
<bos>- Mulder, can you understand me?<eos>
<bos>Mulder, you've got to get up.<eos>
<bos>I don't know how much time we have.<eos>
<bos>- You've got to get up, Mulder.<eos>
<bos>No one can do it but you, Mulder.<eos>
<bos>Mulder, help me.<eos>
<bos>Please, Mulder.<eos>
<bos>You... help me.<eos>
<bos>but I couldn't find a tie<eol>to go with my victory cap.<eos>
<bos>Mulder, no work.<eol>You have to go back to bed.<eos>
<bos>Oh, wait. Tie goes to the runner.<eos>
<bos>Scully, I, uh...<eos>
<bos>I was comin' down to work to tell you...<eos>
<bos>that Albert Hosteen is dead.<eos>
<bos>He died last night in New Mexico.<eos>
<bos>He was there. We... We prayed together.<eos>
<bos>Mulder, I don't believe that.<eol>I... I don't believe it. It's impossible.<eos>
<bos>Is it any more impossible than what you<eol>saw in Africa or what you saw in me?<eos>
<bos>I don't know what to believe anymore.<eos>
<bos>Mulder, I was so determined<eol>to find a cure to save you...<eos>
<bos>that I could deny what it was that I saw.<eos>
<bos>And now I don't even know.<eol>I don't know...<eos>
<bos>I don't know what the truth is,<eol>I don't know who to listen to,<eos>
<bos>I don't know who to trust.<eos>
<bos>Diana Fowley was found<eol>murdered this morning.<eos>
<bos>I never trusted her.<eos>
<bos>But she helped save your life<eol>just as much as I did.<eos>
<bos>She gave me that book.<eos>
<bos>It was her key that led me to you.<eos>
<bos>I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.<eos>
<bos>I know she was your friend.<eos>
<bos>Scully, I was like you once.<eol>I didn't know who to trust and I...<eos>
<bos>I chose another path,<eos>
<bos>another life, another fate<eol>where I found my sister.<eos>
<bos>And even though my world<eol>was unrecognizable and upside down,<eos>
<bos>there was one thing<eol>that remained the same.<eos>
<bos>You were my friend...<eos>
<bos>and you told me the truth.<eos>
<bos>Even when the world was falling apart,<eol>you were my constant,<eos>
<bos>my touchstone.<eos>
<bos>And you are mine.<eos>
<bos>Ah!<eos>
