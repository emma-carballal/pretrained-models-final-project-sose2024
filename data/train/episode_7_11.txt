<bos>I came in search<eol>of something I did not believe existed.<eos>
<bos>I've stayed on now in spite of myself,<eos>
<bos>in spite of everything<eol>I've ever held to be true.<eos>
<bos>I will continue here as long as I can...<eos>
<bos>as long as you are beset<eol>by the haunting illness...<eos>
<bos>which I saw consume your beautiful mind.<eos>
<bos>What is this discovery I've made?<eos>
<bos>How can I reconcile what I see<eol>with what I know?<eos>
<bos>I feel this was meant not for me to find,<eos>
<bos>but for you to make sense of...<eos>
<bos>make the connections<eol>which can't be ignored.<eos>
<bos>Connections which, for me,<eol>deny all logic and reason.<eos>
<bos>What is this source of power<eol>I hold in my hand... this rubbing?<eos>
<bos>This simple impression taken<eol>from the surface of the craft?<eos>
<bos>I watched this rubbing take<eol>its undeniable hold on you...<eos>
<bos>saw you succumb to its spiraling effect.<eos>
<bos>Now, I must work to uncover...<eos>
<bos>what your illness<eol>prevents you from finding.<eos>
<bos>In the source of every illness<eol>lies its cure.<eos>
<bos>Who's there?<eos>
<bos>Who's there?<eos>
<bos>He's been quiet for the last 36 hours.<eos>
<bos>But he doesn't sleep.<eos>
<bos>There's activity in the temporal lobe...<eos>
<bos>we've just never seen.<eos>
<bos>It won't allow his brain<eol>to rest or shut down,<eos>
<bos>manifesting in episodes of aggression.<eos>
<bos>Sometimes against himself.<eos>
<bos>- You can't sedate him? - Yes.<eos>
<bos>We slow him down for short periods<eol>and put him in the neuro ward.<eos>
<bos>It's the only way<eol>we're able to run tests.<eos>
<bos>But over time,<eos>
<bos>his brain is going to just die.<eos>
<bos>Agent Mulder?<eos>
<bos>Agent Mulder, can you hear me?<eos>
<bos>Do you know who I am?<eos>
<bos>It's Skinner. Walter Skinner.<eos>
<bos>Can we get him out of here?<eol>Get him some fresh air, at least?<eos>
<bos>Let him go! He can't breathe!<eos>
<bos>Come on. Let him go.<eos>
<bos>- Stay there, Mr. Skinner.<eos>
<bos>No, it's all right. Just let me get up.<eos>
<bos>- Five milligrams of haloperidol, I.M.<eos>
<bos>- I want him in five-point restraints.<eos>
<bos>Yes, sir.<eos>
<bos>My God.<eos>
<bos>What happened here?<eos>
<bos>They said you speak English.<eos>
<bos>- What do you want? -  I'm sorry.<eos>
<bos>You must wonder who I am.<eol>I'm Amina Ngebe.<eos>
<bos>I have come to see your discovery.<eos>
<bos>I asked that no one be told about it,<eol>nor that I'm here.<eos>
<bos>Yes, well, it is still a secret,<eos>
<bos>but a well-known one, I'm afraid.<eos>
<bos>Dr. Merkmallen called it<eol>the 'African internet. "God rest him.<eos>
<bos>You knew Dr. Merkmallen?<eos>
<bos>I, too, am a professor<eol>of biology at the university.<eos>
<bos>But, uh, hardly one qualified<eol>to say what must have gone on here.<eos>
<bos>Well, I was working late<eol>last night by lamplight,<eos>
<bos>and, uh, I saw a man who vanished.<eos>
<bos>And then they just swarmed.<eos>
<bos>You must not let the men know...<eos>
<bos>what happened to you last night.<eos>
<bos>The vanishing man, none of it.<eos>
<bos>Why?<eos>
<bos>They are animists,<eos>
<bos>believing nature is vengeful.<eos>
<bos>They'll take this as a sign<eol>to leave what you have found alone.<eos>
<bos>- A bad omen.<eol>- Caused by the ship out there?<eos>
<bos>Mmm. Caused by God,<eos>
<bos>who will be much less helpful<eol>than those men...<eos>
<bos>if we are to continue this work.<eos>
<bos>Quick! He's gotta get to a hospital!<eos>
<bos>- Hospital!<eos>
<bos>Okay!<eos>
<bos>You see? Another warning.<eos>
<bos>Agent Mulder?<eos>
<bos>I want to help you.<eos>
<bos>I don't know what to do.<eol>I don't have much time.<eos>
<bos>Can you write?<eos>
<bos>I feel you slipping away from me<eol>with every minute I fail here.<eos>
<bos>What are the elusive meanings<eol>I cannot see...<eos>
<bos>that are hidden here?<eos>
<bos>If I could understand it,<eol>know how it affected you,<eos>
<bos>learn how to use its power to save you...<eos>
<bos>What is it?<eos>
<bos>Look, I'm sorry.<eol>I don't speak your language.<eos>
<bos>Perhaps you need an interpreter?<eos>
<bos>Stay away from me!<eos>
<bos>Are you gonna hack me up<eol>in front of my driver?<eos>
<bos>Murderer of who?<eos>
<bos>Dr. Merkmallen.<eos>
<bos>I murdered no one.<eol>But I won't be sent away from here.<eos>
<bos>I know what we've got.<eos>
<bos>This craft that's come ashore,<eol>its extraterrestrial origins.<eos>
<bos>You don't even believe in that.<eos>
<bos>Nor do you, but here we are.<eos>
<bos>I'm here only to help my partner.<eos>
<bos>Then let me help you...<eos>
<bos>to read it.<eos>
<bos>I've spent my life looking<eol>for what's out there.<eos>
<bos>The answer to what theologians<eol>have pondered for millennia.<eos>
<bos>The key to everything... to life itself.<eos>
<bos>I've already been threatened...<eos>
<bos>by men in Washington about what I know.<eos>
<bos>How long would your secret keep<eol>if you were to send me away?<eos>
<bos>What is it?<eos>
<bos>It is a sea of blood.<eos>
<bos>Yeah.<eos>
<bos>- Michael Kritschgau?<eol>- It's 6:00 in the morning.<eos>
<bos>I don't know if you remember me.<eol>My name's Skinner.<eos>
<bos>He's in a serious condition,<eol>Mr. Kritschgau. He asked to talk to you.<eos>
<bos>I got nothin' to say to the man.<eos>
<bos>You know, I had a job...<eos>
<bos>with a government pension coming.<eos>
<bos>And two years ago,<eol>Fox Mulder asked me to do him a favor.<eos>
<bos>Blow the whistle on Uncle Sam's<eol>U.F.O. propaganda mill.<eos>
<bos>And all it got me<eol>was this swanky address.<eos>
<bos>Look, he doesn't have much time.<eos>
<bos>Hey, I'm not a doctor.<eol>What is it you think I can do for him?<eos>
<bos>All I know is that he asked for you.<eos>
<bos>Can he even recognize me?<eos>
<bos>To be honest, I don't know.<eos>
<bos>- Agent Mulder?<eos>
<bos>His brain is on constant redline.<eos>
<bos>They've got him on haloperidol<eol>just to keep him on the monitors.<eos>
<bos>- Haloperidol?<eol>- He becomes violently agitated.<eos>
<bos>He just won't speak or sleep,<eol>even when he's medicated.<eos>
<bos>There's activity in part of his brain<eol>they've never seen before.<eos>
<bos>- Was his...<eos>
<bos>Was his what?<eos>
<bos>I started to ask you a question<eol>about his prior mental state,<eos>
<bos>but he anticipated it.<eos>
<bos>Second time.<eos>
<bos>- Agent Mulder?<eos>
<bos>He claimed to be hearing voices.<eos>
<bos>I might know why<eol>Agent Mulder asked for me.<eos>
<bos>I think he responded<eol>to a question that... I didn't ask.<eos>
<bos>You asked me to come down here.<eos>
<bos>You better be prepared to accept<eol>the responsibility, Mr. Skinner.<eos>
<bos>- You're going to inject him?<eol>- No. You are.<eos>
<bos>With a thousand milligrams of phenytoin.<eos>
<bos>He's being given the wrong treatment.<eos>
<bos>- You're not a doctor.<eol>- No, but I've seen his condition.<eos>
<bos>Who do you want to trust?<eos>
<bos>Seen it where?<eos>
<bos>In a study.<eos>
<bos>There's something like E.S.P.<eol>called "remote viewing."<eos>
<bos>Extreme subjects would go into arrest,<eos>
<bos>their minds working harder<eol>than their bodies could sustain.<eos>
<bos>They became, in effect, all brain.<eos>
<bos>Agent Mulder knew about this.<eos>
<bos>That's why he asked for you.<eos>
<bos>They're coming.<eos>
<bos>- Who last saw him? - I'm looking here.<eos>
<bos>I come here and find a patient missing,<eol>and nobody knew?<eos>
<bos>Well, I just came on.<eol>Sorry. Uh, Fox Mulder, right?<eos>
<bos>He's restrained, it says.<eol>And he's not in his bed?<eos>
<bos>No. How many times can I say it?<eos>
<bos>He's right here.<eos>
<bos>He wasn't here when I came in.<eos>
<bos>No, we just found him down the hall.<eos>
<bos>- I just got him back into bed.<eol>- Who are you?<eos>
<bos>- I'm his boss, and hers.<eol>- Well, I don't know...<eos>
<bos>how he could've gotten up by himself<eol>or pulled all this stuff out.<eos>
<bos>Well, I hope someone's calling a doctor<eol>and making a report on this.<eos>
<bos>Well, I hope someone's calling a doctor<eol>and making a report on this.<eos>
<bos>He has got to remain in this bed.<eos>
<bos>I'll stay with him.<eos>
<bos>Agent Fowley, why don't you see<eol>if you can help her.<eos>
<bos>That's an order, Agent Fowley.<eos>
<bos>She knows.<eos>
<bos>- You can read her mind? - Yeah.<eos>
<bos>- We gotta act fast.<eol>- The doctor's on his way.<eos>
<bos>- No doctors. Get me Scully.<eol>- I don't know where she is.<eos>
<bos>Look, I know you've been compromised.<eos>
<bos>I know Krycek is threatening your life,<eos>
<bos>blackmailing you.<eos>
<bos>You don't think I can trust you.<eos>
<bos>But it's not you that I need.<eos>
<bos>- Then who? - Him.<eos>
<bos>Kritschgau.<eos>
<bos>- Ask him to prove it. - Prove what?<eos>
<bos>What's causing this.<eos>
<bos>It's a brain abnormality.<eol>It's how you're able to read minds.<eos>
<bos>What's causing this is alien.<eol>It's why my doctors can't help me.<eos>
<bos>I don't believe in aliens, Agent Mulder.<eol>I think you know that.<eos>
<bos>I do. That's why I need you.<eos>
<bos>The work here is painstaking.<eos>
<bos>A slow and tedious piecing together.<eos>
<bos>It appears to be a craft...<eos>
<bos>its skin covered in the intricate<eol>symbols you and I both saw,<eos>
<bos>but which I now understand<eol>are part of a complex communication.<eos>
<bos>Dr. Barnes has broken some<eol>of the symbols into letters,<eos>
<bos>using an ancient Navaho alphabet.<eos>
<bos>And though it has helped<eol>to uncover some of what's here,<eos>
<bos>it has also made for greater confusion.<eos>
<bos>On the top surface of the craft,<eol>I'm finding words...<eos>
<bos>describing human genetics.<eos>
<bos>Efforts to read the bottom<eol>of the craft have been harder.<eos>
<bos>Our workers were scared away<eol>by a phenomena I admit I can't explain.<eos>
<bos>A sea of blood, a swarm of insects.<eos>
<bos>But what little we've found<eol>has been staggering.<eos>
<bos>Passages from the Christian Bible,<eos>
<bos>from Pagan religions,<eol>from ancient Sumaria.<eos>
<bos>Science and mysticism conjoined.<eos>
<bos>But more than words,<eol>they are somehow imbued with power.<eos>
<bos>I've ignored warnings to quit this work,<eos>
<bos>remaining committed to finding answers,<eos>
<bos>afraid only that<eol>our secret here won't last...<eos>
<bos>and that I might be too late.<eos>
<bos>I have something to show you.<eos>
<bos>More pieces of the puzzle.<eos>
<bos>I couldn't believe it.<eos>
<bos>I thought I was making it up in my head,<eos>
<bos>- That it could not be true. - What?<eos>
<bos>What this is.<eos>
<bos>What the symbols spell out<eol>is a passage from the Koran.<eos>
<bos>Quyama... the day of final judgement.<eos>
<bos>On a spacecraft,<eos>
<bos>teachings of<eol>the ancient prophet Mohammed?<eos>
<bos>I found more too.<eos>
<bos>Twenty-four panels.<eos>
<bos>One for each human chromosome.<eos>
<bos>A map of their makeup. Maybe a map...<eos>
<bos>of our entire genetic makeup.<eos>
<bos>A complete human genome.<eos>
<bos>I mean, it's like...<eos>
<bos>it's the most beautiful,<eol>intricate work of art.<eos>
<bos>It is the word of God.<eos>
<bos>You're wrong.<eos>
<bos>There is no God.<eos>
<bos>What's out there in the water...<eos>
<bos>is only what we call "God"...<eos>
<bos>what we call "creation."<eos>
<bos>The spark that ignited<eol>the fire that cooked...<eos>
<bos>the old primordial soup.<eos>
<bos>Made animate from inanimate. Made us.<eos>
<bos>I believe he is mad from the sun.<eos>
<bos>Mad? I'm perfectly sane.<eos>
<bos>Because today, I understand everything.<eos>
<bos>Beginning and end, alpha and omega,<eol>everything in between.<eos>
<bos>It's all been written,<eol>but the word is extraterrestrial.<eos>
<bos>You're sick, Dr. Barnes.<eos>
<bos>You need to get off your feet.<eos>
<bos>Lie down.<eos>
<bos>You think you're going<eol>to take the credit?<eos>
<bos>This is my discovery.<eos>
<bos>I'm only here to help my friend.<eos>
<bos>You can't help him.<eos>
<bos>You're wasting your time reading it.<eos>
<bos>It has power.<eos>
<bos>It is power.<eos>
<bos>The ultimate power.<eos>
<bos>Your friend just got too close.<eos>
<bos>No one leaves here before me.<eos>
<bos>We developed this<eol>to test remote viewing capabilities.<eos>
<bos>It works much like a card trick.<eos>
<bos>You tap the monitor where<eol>the saucer image appears,<eos>
<bos>when it appears,<eol>or when you think it does.<eos>
<bos>Okay?<eos>
<bos>Who are you gonna call?<eos>
<bos>Now.<eos>
<bos>Now. Now.<eos>
<bos>Now. Now.<eos>
<bos>Now. Now.<eos>
<bos>- Now. - All right, Agent Mulder. Fine.<eos>
<bos>You're at about five percent accuracy.<eos>
<bos>I'm assuming that's low.<eos>
<bos>Yeah. At the C.I.A., a high degree<eol>of ability was 20 percent.<eos>
<bos>- Twenty-five percent was extraordinary.<eol>- But I see them in my head.<eos>
<bos>You saw his ability earlier.<eol>It was you who pointed it out.<eos>
<bos>Well, our tests show that some people<eol>have psychic ability, sure.<eos>
<bos>I mean, E.S.P., clairvoyance,<eol>remote viewing.<eos>
<bos>But it was never attributed to aliens.<eos>
<bos>You don't want to believe.<eos>
<bos>You're not looking hard enough.<eos>
<bos>One more time... faster.<eos>
<bos>He's ahead of the images.<eos>
<bos>He's anticipating them.<eos>
<bos>They've come back!<eos>
<bos>They were dead!<eos>
<bos>They've come back to life!<eos>
<bos>The ship... it brought them back to life!<eos>
<bos>We have to get to the police.<eos>
<bos>That is where I am going.<eol>This is the road to Abajan.<eos>
<bos>- Stop!<eos>
<bos>That was him!<eos>
<bos>That was the man I saw in the tent...<eol>in the road.<eos>
<bos>Some truths are not for you.<eos>
<bos>- Are you all right?<eos>
<bos>- Oh, God. What are you doing?<eol>- You were cold.<eos>
<bos>I was just feeling to see<eol>if you were still alive.<eos>
<bos>- What happened to you? - To me?<eos>
<bos>You slammed on the brakes.<eol>There was a man.<eos>
<bos>- That's right... in the road. - No.<eos>
<bos>He was right there, sitting<eol>right where you are in your seat.<eos>
<bos>The men were right. This is a bad sign.<eos>
<bos>A sign to give up.<eos>
<bos>- Turn us around.<eol>- Not back to the beach.<eos>
<bos>No. I'm going home.<eos>
<bos>Agent Mulder?<eos>
<bos>Agent Mulder, I don't know<eol>if you can hear me,<eos>
<bos>but we're gonna try<eol>to get you out of here.<eos>
<bos>A.M. nurse is on in five minutes.<eos>
<bos>- We gotta move.<eol>- I don't think he's in any shape.<eos>
<bos>I'm gonna hit him pretty hard.<eos>
<bos>Maybe we can get him on his feet.<eos>
<bos>- What are you doing?<eol>- Look, I know what you're doing.<eos>
<bos>- I'm trying to help him.<eol>- This isn't about him.<eos>
<bos>It's about you. It's about revenge<eol>against the government...<eos>
<bos>for trying to destroy your life.<eos>
<bos>I was destroyed to protect what Mulder<eol>knew all along. Now he's the proof.<eos>
<bos>- It's gone too far.<eol>- How far should it go?<eos>
<bos>How far would Mulder go?<eos>
<bos>- Hey, what's going on here?<eos>
<bos>Let me see your hands. Hands!<eos>
<bos>Step away.<eos>
<bos>Agent Fowley, what the hell<eol>do you think you're doing?<eos>
<bos>What am I doing?<eol>What are you doing, sir, with this?<eos>
<bos>I want you to face the wall.<eos>
<bos>Do you hear me? Face the wall!<eos>
<bos>- Let me explain.<eol>- What was this man given?<eos>
<bos>What was in this syringe?<eos>
<bos>Phenytoin.<eos>
<bos>Let me tell you what it does.<eos>
<bos>How much did you give him?<eol>What dosage was this?<eos>
<bos>- Let me tell you why we did it.<eos>
<bos>He's going into seizure!<eos>
<bos>Watch his head!<eos>
<bos>Mr. Mulder?<eos>
<bos>Hold him. Hold him.<eos>
<bos>Dr. Barnes?<eos>
<bos>Dr. Barnes?<eos>
<bos>- I'm so sorry.<eos>
<bos>I know what's happened to you.<eos>
<bos>I know what you're suffering from.<eos>
<bos>I've been sitting back and watching.<eos>
<bos>I know you know.<eos>
<bos>I know you know about me.<eos>
<bos>That my loyalties aren't just to you,<eos>
<bos>but to a man you've grown to despise.<eos>
<bos>You have your reasons.<eos>
<bos>But as you look inside me now,<eol>you know that I have mine.<eos>
<bos>Fox?<eos>
<bos>Fox, I love you.<eos>
<bos>I've loved you for so long.<eos>
<bos>You know that too.<eos>
<bos>And I won't let you die...<eos>
<bos>to prove what you are...<eol>to prove what's inside you.<eos>
<bos>There's no need to prove it.<eos>
<bos>It's been known for so long.<eos>
<bos>Now we can be together.<eos>
<bos>-  Where is he?<eos>
<bos>- Is he still in the hospital?<eol>- Where have you been?<eos>
<bos>Is he still at Georgetown Memorial?<eos>
<bos>He's in the neuro psych ward,<eol>but it's no good, Agent Scully.<eos>
<bos>- Agent Scully!<eol>- I have been on a plane for 22 hours.<eos>
<bos>if you can even get on the ward.<eos>
<bos>There's been some trouble.<eos>
<bos>What kind of trouble?<eos>
<bos>- I got this man Kritschgau involved.<eol>- Kritschgau?<eos>
<bos>It's a long story, but it ended badly.<eos>
<bos>They've got Mulder under security now<eol>around the clock.<eos>
<bos>I take full responsibility.<eos>
<bos>Responsibility for what?<eos>
<bos>He can't even communicate, Agent Scully.<eos>
<bos>They won't treat him because<eol>they don't know what's wrong with him.<eos>
<bos>They said he was dying.<eol>I had to do something.<eos>
<bos>He's not dying.<eos>
<bos>I'm afraid it's true.<eos>
<bos>He's not dying.<eos>
<bos>He is more alive than he's ever been.<eos>
<bos>He's more alive than<eol>his body can withstand.<eos>
<bos>And what's causing it<eol>may be extraterrestrial in origin.<eos>
<bos>I know.<eos>
<bos>But there's nothing to be done about it.<eos>
<bos>They're going to deny you access.<eos>
<bos>Maybe as his partner,<eos>
<bos>but not as his doctor.<eos>
<bos>He's alive.<eos>
<bos>He's come back to life.<eos>
<bos>Holy Mother of God!<eos>
<bos>Hello?<eos>
<bos>Please.<eos>
<bos>I need to see him.<eos>
<bos>I'm begging you, please.<eos>
<bos>Thank you.<eos>
<bos>Mulder, it's me.<eos>
<bos>I know that you can hear me.<eos>
<bos>If you can just give me some sign.<eos>
<bos>I want you to know where I've been...<eos>
<bos>what I found.<eos>
<bos>I think that if you know,<eos>
<bos>that you could find a way to hold on.<eos>
<bos>I need you to hold on.<eos>
<bos>I found a key...<eos>
<bos>the key...<eos>
<bos>to every question<eol>that has ever been asked.<eos>
<bos>It's a puzzle.<eos>
<bos>But the pieces are there<eol>for us to put together.<eos>
<bos>And I know that they can save you<eol>if you can just hold on.<eos>
<bos>Mulder?<eos>
<bos>Please.<eos>
<bos>Hold on.<eos>
