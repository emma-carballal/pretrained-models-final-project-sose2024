<bos>Mr. Maleeni.<eos>
<bos>Hey, guy. You ready to rumble?<eos>
<bos>If by "rumble" you mean perform,<eol>yes, I am.<eos>
<bos>Cool. You know how he said<eol>you get 125 for the day?<eos>
<bos>It's gonna be 75 instead.<eol>The gate's for crap.<eos>
<bos>But, hey, the show's gotta go on, right?<eos>
<bos>- This will be my greatest show ever.<eol>- Right on.<eos>
<bos>Ladies and gentlemen, damas y caballeros,<eos>
<bos>I aim today not just<eol>to entertain but to educate,<eos>
<bos>to instruct and inform<eol>in the venerable...<eos>
<bos>- And ancient history of my art.<eos>
<bos>UntilJohann Nepomuk Hofsinzer...<eos>
<bos>called playing cards the poetry of magic,<eos>
<bos>a conjuror's skill was determined<eol>entirely by his ability...<eos>
<bos>to perform one effect.<eos>
<bos>That effect was known<eol>as the cups and balls.<eos>
<bos>The games were known for hundreds,<eol>if not thousands of years.<eos>
<bos>Perhaps the greatest performer<eol>was the Italian Bartolomeo Bosco.<eos>
<bos>Get on with it.<eos>
<bos>Bosco's passes with the cups and balls.<eos>
<bos>Wah-day...<eos>
<bos>chubio...<eos>
<bos>colerader.<eos>
<bos>Three gone...<eos>
<bos>and yet three... return.<eos>
<bos>Bosco had only one contemporary rival,<eos>
<bos>a slightly older Frenchman named Conus,<eol>who announced in 1795...<eos>
<bos>Practice though I have,<eol>I have been unable even to get married.<eos>
<bos>Conus placed one ball in his pocket.<eos>
<bos>He put the second ball away.<eos>
<bos>Putting the third ball in his hand,<eol>he made it vanish,<eos>
<bos>and that's the mystery...<eos>
<bos>of the cups and the balls.<eos>
<bos>Yo! Can't you do anything<eol>that ain't a hundred years old?<eos>
<bos>That ain't old school, that's decrepit.<eos>
<bos>Young man, shall I come<eol>heckle you on your job?<eos>
<bos>Make sure you count out<eol>the requisite number of McNuggets?<eos>
<bos>Show me somethin'.<eos>
<bos>Come on. Show me somethin'.<eos>
<bos>A callow challenge to be met<eol>by experience and skill.<eos>
<bos>To wit, the Egyptian Dedi,<eos>
<bos>whose most celebrated feat...<eos>
<bos>was to reattach a recently severed head,<eos>
<bos>reuniting it with the still-warm body...<eos>
<bos>and no harm done.<eos>
<bos>Western history knows...<eos>
<bos>three previous attempts at recreating...<eos>
<bos>this Noachian feat,<eos>
<bos>each of the three ending in tragedy.<eos>
<bos>This will be the fourth.<eos>
<bos>May I have complete silence, please?<eos>
<bos>- Yeah!<eos>
<bos>Senor Maleeni! Ho ho!<eos>
<bos>Folks, let's give it up<eol>for the Amazing Maleeni.<eos>
<bos>Guy, you rock. That kicked ass.<eol>I mean, it looked completely real.<eos>
<bos>How did you do that?<eos>
<bos>Oh, yeah, right. Magic.<eos>
<bos>Oh, hey, your money. Hold up.<eos>
<bos>Two, four, fifty, fifty-five, sixty,<eol>sixty-five, seventy, seventy-five.<eos>
<bos>You earned it. Mr. Maleeni?<eos>
<bos>Mr. Maleeni.<eos>
<bos>Oh, God! Oh...<eos>
<bos>Whew.<eos>
<bos>- Neat trick, huh?<eol>- I can think of a neater one...<eos>
<bos>Come on, Scully.<eol>This isn't intriguing enough for you?<eos>
<bos>A magician turns his head<eol>completely around, 360 degrees,<eos>
<bos>to the delight of young and old alike,<eos>
<bos>after which it plops<eol>unceremoniously onto the pier.<eos>
<bos>- See the picture?<eol>- Yeah, I saw the picture.<eos>
<bos>And as for this Amazing Maleeni<eol>turning his head all the way around...<eos>
<bos>Like you said, Mulder, neat trick.<eos>
<bos>- But? - But... I'd guess this event...<eos>
<bos>was completely removed<eol>from his subsequent murder.<eos>
<bos>- You think this was a murder?<eol>- Don't you?<eos>
<bos>Mulder, his head was cut off.<eos>
<bos>Ah. Observe the nearly<eol>complete absence of blood.<eos>
<bos>- Of lycopodium powder.<eol>- Why are you talking like Tony Randall?<eos>
<bos>Know that the Amazing Maleeni was alive<eol>one moment and expired the next.<eos>
<bos>Mulder, I admit that I<eol>don't know how it happened,<eos>
<bos>but I still say that it was a murder.<eos>
<bos>- So what's your theory?<eol>- A magic trick gone horribly wrong.<eos>
<bos>One that claims the lives<eol>of all who attempt it.<eos>
<bos>Can I see that camcorder again?<eos>
<bos>Thank you.<eos>
<bos>A tourist videotaped...<eos>
<bos>Maleeni's performance.<eos>
<bos>This...<eos>
<bos>That ain't old school, that's decrepit.<eos>
<bos>-  Show me somethin'.<eol>- Who's the heckler?<eos>
<bos>Come on. Show me somethin'.<eos>
<bos>I don't know.<eos>
<bos>Neat trick, huh?<eos>
<bos>Hang on a second. Let me see this.<eos>
<bos>That heckler's pretty hard to impress,<eol>wouldn't you say?<eos>
<bos>Look at him. He just takes off in a huff.<eos>
<bos>I don't know. That'd be a neat trick<eol>in itself. You never see his face.<eos>
<bos>Ah! But observe.<eos>
<bos>His discarded soda cup.<eos>
<bos>The hand may be quicker than the eye,<eol>but it still leaves fingerprints.<eos>
<bos>- Provided they haven't dumped the trash.<eol>- Skeptic.<eos>
<bos>Mr. LaBonge?<eos>
<bos>We're agents Mulder and Scully<eol>from the F.B.I.<eos>
<bos>Were you at the Santa Monica Pier<eol>yesterday morning?<eos>
<bos>Yeah.<eos>
<bos>You attended a magic show,<eol>the Amazing Maleeni?<eos>
<bos>Yeah, he sucks. Why?<eos>
<bos>He's dead, under extremely<eol>suspicious circumstances.<eos>
<bos>He still sucks.<eos>
<bos>- How'd you find me? - Your fingerprints.<eos>
<bos>- You have a criminal record.<eol>- A conviction for pickpocketing.<eos>
<bos>Man, that was performance art.<eol>Besides, it's ancient history.<eos>
<bos>What are you saying?<eol>You think I killed him?<eos>
<bos>Well, you're on videotape<eol>heckling the deceased.<eos>
<bos>What did you have against Mr. Maleeni?<eos>
<bos>First of all, his name's not Maleeni.<eos>
<bos>That's the name of a real magician,<eos>
<bos>a guy at the turn of the century,<eol>Max Malini.<eos>
<bos>- Ever hear of him? - No.<eos>
<bos>It's too bad. You should've.<eos>
<bos>Anyway, he steals his name,<eol>spells it a little differently...<eos>
<bos>What about the trick where he<eol>turns his head completely around?<eos>
<bos>Check it out.<eos>
<bos>No problem. Did you like that?<eos>
<bos>- Yeah. - Watch.<eos>
<bos>A coin in the hand... blows away.<eos>
<bos>Maybe it's a little bit<eol>hard for you to see.<eos>
<bos>Let me make that... bigger for you.<eos>
<bos>Mozart and Salieri.<eos>
<bos>They sound pretty much<eol>the same to a layman.<eos>
<bos>But they ain't. You know what I'm sayin'?<eos>
<bos>It's about originality.<eos>
<bos>Style.<eos>
<bos>And more than anything else...<eos>
<bos>soul.<eos>
<bos>Because that's what separates<eol>the great ones...<eos>
<bos>from the hacks.<eos>
<bos>We can't do this halfway. We're dealing<eol>with powerful forces at work here.<eos>
<bos>Energies far beyond our mere...<eos>
<bos>mortal... understanding.<eos>
<bos>Enough to make a magician lose his head?<eos>
<bos>Could be.<eos>
<bos>That, and I hear Maleeni racked up<eol>some pretty big gambling debts.<eos>
<bos>Who knows who he might've pissed off.<eos>
<bos>Thank you, Mr. LaBonge.<eol>We'll, uh, be in touch.<eos>
<bos>Please do. Oh, and agents?<eos>
<bos>Mozart and Salieri. Which one's which?<eos>
<bos>Mulder, I think that<eol>professional jealousy...<eos>
<bos>is as good a motive for murder as any.<eos>
<bos>If it was a murder. I'm not convinced.<eos>
<bos>If I can get Mr. Maleeni<eol>into an autopsy bay,<eos>
<bos>hopefully we can put this issue<eol>to rest as soon as possible.<eos>
<bos>All right, I'm stumped.<eol>I think I'm supposed to be.<eos>
<bos>- What do you think?<eol>- Well, first of all,<eos>
<bos>I'm sorry to disappoint you,<eol>but Mr. Maleeni's head...<eos>
<bos>didn't just magically fall off.<eos>
<bos>It was very carefully sawed.<eos>
<bos>Very slow and exacting work,<eos>
<bos>probably with a fine-tooth meat saw.<eos>
<bos>And check out this little detail.<eos>
<bos>Spirit gum, Mulder.<eos>
<bos>It held the head to the body.<eos>
<bos>- Just barely, of course.<eol>- So he was murdered?<eos>
<bos>Well, no. As far as I can tell, this man<eol>died of advanced coronary disease.<eos>
<bos>- Natural causes. - Yeah.<eos>
<bos>and then glued it back on all in<eol>the space of 30 seconds.<eos>
<bos>- Does that make sense to you? - No.<eos>
<bos>Which makes it even stranger still,<eos>
<bos>because as far as I can tell...<eos>
<bos>this body has been dead for over a month.<eos>
<bos>I see signs of refrigeration.<eos>
<bos>And yet he performed yesterday.<eos>
<bos>- What a trouper.<eol>- Well, somebody performed yesterday.<eos>
<bos>Cissy Alvarez.<eos>
<bos>Who are you?<eos>
<bos>You don't remember me.<eol>Ain't that a bitch?<eos>
<bos>My name's LaBonge. I did time<eol>with you about eight years ago.<eos>
<bos>I hear you're a poker player.<eos>
<bos>You won big off a guy who<eol>calls himself the Amazing Maleeni.<eos>
<bos>Also goes by the name<eol>of Herman Pinchbeck.<eos>
<bos>- Pinchbeck? - He's dead.<eos>
<bos>Yeah, I saw in the paper.<eos>
<bos>Something about his head fell off.<eol>Yeah. What's it to you?<eos>
<bos>I'm the guy that made his head fall off.<eos>
<bos>You took his marker, right?<eol>What'd he owe you, 15 grand?<eos>
<bos>You want to cut to the chase?<eos>
<bos>You know, get a little more of your<eol>story out before we stomp you to death?<eos>
<bos>How would you like to get back<eol>what you're owed times ten?<eos>
<bos>200,000. Mm. How?<eos>
<bos>- Helping me. - Do what?<eos>
<bos>Magic.<eos>
<bos>Wanna hear more?<eos>
<bos>Excuse me. I'm looking<eol>for Mr. Albert Pinchbeck.<eos>
<bos>- He look familiar to you, Scully?<eol>- He certainly does.<eos>
<bos>- The plot thickens.<eol>- He might try and run.<eos>
<bos>Come in.<eos>
<bos>- Good morning, Mr. And Mrs...<eol>- Agents Mulder and Scully, F.B.I.<eos>
<bos>You're not here for a home loan,<eol>I take it.<eos>
<bos>No. We are investigating<eol>the death of a magician...<eos>
<bos>who called himself the Amazing Maleeni.<eos>
<bos>Herman Pinchbeck, my twin brother.<eos>
<bos>Yes, we know. We checked his next of kin.<eos>
<bos>Car accident.<eos>
<bos>So your injured neck has nothing<eol>to do with a magic trick...<eos>
<bos>you performed at the Santa Monica Pier<eol>two days ago,<eos>
<bos>one which involved you turning your head<eol>around 360 degrees?<eos>
<bos>Well, no. That wasn't me.<eos>
<bos>I was in a bad car accident in Mexico.<eos>
<bos>A bad Mexican car accident in Mexico.<eos>
<bos>- Do you know magic, Mr. Pinchbeck?<eol>- Yes, I do.<eos>
<bos>Back in the '70s,<eol>my brother and I performed together.<eos>
<bos>- Why'd you stop?<eol>- You never really stop.<eos>
<bos>Pick a card, any card?<eos>
<bos>Hmm.<eos>
<bos>- Very impressive.<eol>- My brother and I both wanted to do...<eos>
<bos>the absolute best magic<eol>the world had ever seen.<eos>
<bos>The difference was,<eol>I knew we'd never get there,<eos>
<bos>but he always believed we would.<eos>
<bos>We didn't talk much after I quit the act.<eos>
<bos>I have a theory, Mr. Pinchbeck,<eol>and I'm gonna tell you how it goes.<eos>
<bos>I think that your brother Herman<eol>died of heart disease...<eos>
<bos>having never made it as<eol>the world's greatest magician.<eos>
<bos>I think that hurt you, just as<eol>your estrangement from him hurt you.<eos>
<bos>I think what you did was perform<eol>his last act for him.<eos>
<bos>One last act for which<eol>he'd always be remembered.<eos>
<bos>One last act that would end with<eol>such a shock, such a denouement,<eos>
<bos>as would be forever remembered<eol>in the annals of magic.<eos>
<bos>That's what I think.<eos>
<bos>I so wish that were true.<eos>
<bos>It was a very bad car accident in Mexico.<eos>
<bos>- Oy! - No kidding.<eos>
<bos>What now?<eos>
<bos>A guy's head falls off,<eol>it's the greatest trick in the world.<eos>
<bos>When there's no discernible point to it,<eos>
<bos>what's the reason for doing<eol>that in the first place?<eos>
<bos>Well, why do people do magic? To<eol>impress, to delight, to gain attention.<eos>
<bos>Well, this one's gaining<eol>mostly police attention.<eos>
<bos>Maybe that's the point.<eos>
<bos>Well, maybe we should<eol>consult an expert...<eos>
<bos>someone who knows magic, who's seen<eol>the greatest trick in the world.<eos>
<bos>Maybe he can help us figure that out.<eos>
<bos>- Mozart. - Yeah.<eos>
<bos>What's in it for me?<eos>
<bos>I mean, let's say I help you out.<eol>What do I get in return?<eos>
<bos>The feeling of pride that comes<eol>from performing your civic duty?<eos>
<bos>How 'bout the chance...<eos>
<bos>to root through the professional secrets<eol>of your least favorite magician?<eos>
<bos>Good for a laugh, I guess.<eos>
<bos>Man, it's worse than I thought.<eos>
<bos>You gotta feed those things, you know.<eos>
<bos>So...<eos>
<bos>- Maleeni wasn't murdered.<eol>- It would seem not.<eos>
<bos>So someone impersonated him<eol>and his crappy act.<eos>
<bos>It's impressive.<eos>
<bos>I'd say the twin brother did it,<eol>but I don't think...<eos>
<bos>he's any better a magician<eol>than Maleeni was.<eos>
<bos>There's that, and he's got no legs.<eos>
<bos>Yeah. Whatever.<eos>
<bos>Yeah. Whatever.<eos>
<bos>Anyway, we're looking for a magician<eol>with the same height and build.<eos>
<bos>A good makeup job and the right wig,<eol>and no one would know the difference.<eos>
<bos>Not even you, I guess.<eos>
<bos>I had a couple of Jell-O shots in me.<eos>
<bos>Hey, how did this impersonator<eol>switch out the dead body?<eos>
<bos>Because magic is all about...<eol>misdirection.<eos>
<bos>Your impersonator simply made sure<eol>everyone was looking the other way...<eos>
<bos>when he pulled Maleeni's body<eol>from its secret hiding place...<eos>
<bos>underneath...<eos>
<bos>the floor.<eos>
<bos>Man, this guy's good.<eos>
<bos>Well, thanks for your expert opinion.<eos>
<bos>I guess we're right back<eol>where we started.<eos>
<bos>Maybe not.<eos>
<bos>You said that, uh, the Amazing Maleeni<eol>had some gambling debts?<eos>
<bos>Yeah, that's what I heard.<eos>
<bos>Check this out. Looks like a marker.<eos>
<bos>$20,000. Pinchbeck.<eos>
<bos>What would this be doing<eol>in Maleeni's van?<eos>
<bos>Thank you, Mr. Pinchbeck.<eos>
<bos>If you could sign here for me.<eos>
<bos>With pleasure.<eos>
<bos>- Anthony, what kind of gun is that?<eol>- Glock 17,.9 millimeter.<eos>
<bos>I've been thinking of maybe<eol>buying one since my accident.<eos>
<bos>Well, here. Take a look.<eos>
<bos>Hmm.<eos>
<bos>- Gosh, it's heavier<eol>than I would've thought.<eos>
<bos>Thank you, Anthony, Marvin.<eos>
<bos>- If you ever want,<eol>I'll take you to the shooting range.<eos>
<bos>- Hmm. - Have a good one, Mr. Pinchbeck.<eos>
<bos>You too.<eos>
<bos>Hello, may I help you?<eos>
<bos>- Damn, you look just like him.<eol>- I'm sorry?<eos>
<bos>Your no-good, malapaga brother...<eos>
<bos>died owing me money...<eos>
<bos>a lot of money.<eos>
<bos>- You're gonna make good. - I'm sorry,<eos>
<bos>but my, uh, brother's debts are his own.<eos>
<bos>I said, you're gonna make good,<eos>
<bos>'cause me and my friends,<eol>we know where you live.<eos>
<bos>- That sound like the rear diff?<eol>- Pull over.<eos>
<bos>Stay here and call it in.<eol>I'll check it out.<eos>
<bos>We got a problem with the rear diff.<eol>We're on Fourth and Main.<eos>
<bos>Checking it out is Anthony.<eos>
<bos>You! In the truck!<eol>Get up where I can see you.<eos>
<bos>Hands where I can see them!<eos>
<bos>Up! Hands up.<eos>
<bos>All right. Get out.<eos>
<bos>Mister, get out...<eos>
<bos>Hey, I got a guy down back here!<eos>
<bos>It was a guy with tattoos!<eol>I shot him four times!<eos>
<bos>I don't understand. He was right here.<eos>
<bos>It's your handwriting, is it not?<eos>
<bos>Mr. Alvarez, please answer the question.<eos>
<bos>That ain't mine.<eol>I don't know where you got that.<eos>
<bos>It's interesting.<eol>Yours are the only fingerprints on it.<eos>
<bos>We ran it through the<eol>California Criminal History Database,<eos>
<bos>to which you seem to be quite well known.<eos>
<bos>So it's my marker.<eos>
<bos>So Pinchbeck owed me money.<eol>It was a friendly game of poker.<eos>
<bos>Very friendly. $20,000 friendly.<eos>
<bos>- Where did you find that?<eol>- In Herman Pinchbeck's van.<eos>
<bos>Where were you last Thursday?<eos>
<bos>Here. All day. Ask 'em.<eos>
<bos>What is it you think I did<eol>to Pinchbeck, huh?<eos>
<bos>What's in it for me?<eol>If I kill him, he ain't gonna pay me.<eos>
<bos>I didn't know what he was.<eos>
<bos>And he sure as hell<eol>couldn't play worth a damn.<eos>
<bos>Don't leave town, Mr. Alvarez.<eos>
<bos>Don't you find it odd that the<eol>Amazing Maleeni's a lousy poker player?<eos>
<bos>Behold... an ordinary household quarter.<eos>
<bos>- Where is it? - It's in your right hand.<eos>
<bos>No, no, no. Ahh-ahh!<eos>
<bos>- That's not bad. Mulder...<eol>- Blow your nose, Scully.<eos>
<bos>- Blow your nose. Come on. Blow. - Achoo.<eos>
<bos>I made you look in one direction,<eol>the quarter went in the other.<eos>
<bos>That's what you think's<eol>happening in this case?<eos>
<bos>I think we're being<eol>led around by our noses.<eos>
<bos>- By whom? Maleeni's already dead.<eol>- It certainly would appear so.<eos>
<bos>But then again, you thought the quarter<eol>was in the right hand.<eos>
<bos>911 emergency. - Yeah, hello?<eos>
<bos>Yeah, I want to report a man with a gun.<eol>He's threatening to kill somebody.<eos>
<bos>- Can you please speak up?<eol>- No, I can't speak up. No, I can't!<eos>
<bos>Sir?<eos>
<bos>Hello? Hello?<eos>
<bos>Son of a bitch.<eos>
<bos>Hey, partner. Hey, guys.<eos>
<bos>- You son of a bitch. - I'm sorry?<eos>
<bos>You tried to frame me.<eos>
<bos>- You're dead.<eos>
<bos>Freeze!<eos>
<bos>Drop your weapon.<eos>
<bos>Hands behind your head. Do it!<eos>
<bos>Put your hand down. Spread your legs.<eos>
<bos>Agents. An unexpected surprise.<eos>
<bos>- I'm fairly busy, actually. - I'll bet.<eos>
<bos>- Hey! What?<eol>- Let's take a little spin, shall we?<eos>
<bos>- What's this all about?<eol>- It's about misdirection, Mr. Pinchbeck.<eos>
<bos>Or should I say the Amazing Maleeni?<eos>
<bos>Mulder!<eos>
<bos>It's a trick, Scully. Voila.<eos>
<bos>Had you fooled.<eos>
<bos>- You're Maleeni? - Call me Herman.<eos>
<bos>I was afraid for my life.<eos>
<bos>That's why I did what I did.<eol>I'm not proud of that.<eos>
<bos>But I owe a lot of money<eol>that I can't possibly pay back.<eos>
<bos>We know... gambling debts<eol>to a man named Alvarez.<eos>
<bos>Yeah, that tattooed psychopath.<eos>
<bos>I've since heard<eol>terrible stories about him,<eos>
<bos>things he did in prison<eol>to fellow inmates.<eos>
<bos>- So why'd you play poker with him?<eol>- He runs a good game.<eos>
<bos>I gamble to supplement my income.<eol>God knows, magic barely pays.<eos>
<bos>Why did you lose? You could've<eol>manipulated the cards, right?<eos>
<bos>Cheat? You're asking why<eol>I don't cheat at cards?<eos>
<bos>- Well, you could, right?<eol>-  Of course, I could.<eos>
<bos>But how would I live with myself?<eol>Who raised you?<eos>
<bos>Well, sir,<eos>
<bos>what does any of this have to do<eol>with your twin brother...<eos>
<bos>being found decapitated<eol>at the Santa Monica Pier?<eos>
<bos>I went to my brother for a loan.<eos>
<bos>Just my luck and his.<eos>
<bos>You found him dead of a heart attack.<eos>
<bos>His body was still warm.<eos>
<bos>Looking at him lifeless,<eos>
<bos>I saw myself, my own eventual mortality.<eos>
<bos>I saw all the things I meant<eol>to accomplish but didn't.<eos>
<bos>It was an opportunity to vanish,<eol>to become someone else.<eos>
<bos>Like I said, I'm not proud of what I did.<eos>
<bos>And so you refrigerated the body.<eos>
<bos>I needed time to figure out<eol>how to pull it all off.<eos>
<bos>Impersonating my brother,<eol>I called the bank,<eos>
<bos>told them I needed a vacation week,<eos>
<bos>a trip to Mexico.<eos>
<bos>Then the bank received word that<eol>I'd been in a terrible accident.<eos>
<bos>It gave me plenty of time away from work.<eos>
<bos>And you posed as an amputee...<eos>
<bos>to allay suspicion that<eol>you weren't your brother.<eos>
<bos>That, and I rather enjoy the sympathy,<eos>
<bos>especially from the women in our office.<eos>
<bos>You, uh, still haven't explained...<eos>
<bos>why you left your brother's body<eol>at the pier,<eos>
<bos>or why you arranged to have<eol>his head fall off.<eos>
<bos>He explained it. He put it<eol>so eloquently when we last spoke.<eos>
<bos>It was my final performance.<eos>
<bos>I wanted to go out with such a shock,<eol>such a denouement,<eos>
<bos>as would forever be remembered<eol>in the annals of magic.<eos>
<bos>That was your last performance.<eos>
<bos>What's this for?<eos>
<bos>Well... I still think you've got<eol>a few tricks up your sleeve.<eos>
<bos>My God.<eos>
<bos>We gave you handicapped parking.<eol>We built you a ramp.<eos>
<bos>Did he have access to the vaults?<eos>
<bos>Well, yes. He has a key to the day gate.<eol>Several of us do.<eos>
<bos>- What are you looking for, Mulder?<eol>- Any hint at all...<eos>
<bos>as to why Maleeni here<eol>is really impersonating his brother.<eos>
<bos>What about this? Could he have<eol>removed the funds electronically?<eos>
<bos>He didn't have security clearance<eol>for E.F.T. s... electronic fund transfers.<eos>
<bos>Maybe he got around the security.<eol>Can we check the withdrawal records?<eos>
<bos>It would require your badge number<eol>and thumbprint...<eos>
<bos>and probably a federal subpoena to boot.<eos>
<bos>We're extra cautious with the E.F. T.s.<eol>You can understand why.<eos>
<bos>There may be an easier way.<eos>
<bos>- If I call up a transaction list<eol>for this terminal...<eos>
<bos>No. No, everything's in order.<eos>
<bos>Mulder, it says here something<eol>about a robbery attempt yesterday.<eos>
<bos>Yeah, that wasn't against us, but the<eol>armored transport service we deal with.<eos>
<bos>No money was taken<eol>and no suspects were caught.<eos>
<bos>Yeah, well, Mr. Pinchbeck was<eol>the employee who signed out the truck.<eos>
<bos>- He knew the schedule.<eol>- I had nothing to do with that.<eos>
<bos>Maybe, maybe not.<eos>
<bos>We'll hold you till we find out.<eos>
<bos>Make sure you don't pull a vanishing act.<eos>
<bos>- Hey.<eos>
<bos>Paul, I'm putting Mr. Pinchbeck in six.<eos>
<bos>Right.<eos>
<bos>Sleep tight.<eos>
<bos>Wait. Don't I get a phone call, sir?<eos>
<bos>- Sir?<eos>
<bos>- How'd it go? - Swimmingly.<eos>
<bos>Abracadabra, man.<eos>
<bos>Oh, damn!<eos>
<bos>Yes. Okay.<eos>
<bos>- All right. All right, thank you.<eol>- Maleeni?<eos>
<bos>Certainly doesn't look like he did this.<eos>
<bos>Lots of fingerprints.<eos>
<bos>Yeah, I guarantee you,<eol>none of them match our thieves.<eos>
<bos>They're too clever to leave clues,<eos>
<bos>except for the ones they want us to find.<eos>
<bos>- Excuse me. May I show you something?<eol>- Hmm.<eos>
<bos>We thought the security-camera footage<eol>might show the robbers.<eos>
<bos>-  Does it?<eol>- No. They all mysteriously...<eos>
<bos>went blank from about 3:00 a.m. to 3:20,<eos>
<bos>Cissy Alvarez, convicted bank robber.<eos>
<bos>- You recognize this man?<eol>- Yeah. Who is he to you?<eos>
<bos>-  I know those tattoos.<eos>
<bos>That's the man who tried to rob my truck.<eos>
<bos>Aah! What the hell, man? What did I do?<eos>
<bos>Yo, F.B.I., what's up?<eol>What's up with this, man?<eos>
<bos>You can't just come bustin'in here!<eol>I got civil rights!<eos>
<bos>I'm gonna call my lawyer,<eol>and then we're gonna see what's what.<eos>
<bos>Yo, what are they lookin' for?<eos>
<bos>- Come on! Somebody talk to me!<eol>-  Shut up!<eos>
<bos>No, you shut up!<eol>Yo, man, this ain't right.<eos>
<bos>Why you got the cuffs on so tight?<eos>
<bos>Yo, will you please tell me<eol>what he's lookin'for?<eos>
<bos>Oh!<eos>
<bos>- What?<eol>- Well. Saving up for a rainy day?<eos>
<bos>- It was the magician!<eol>- The magician? Maleeni?<eos>
<bos>No, not the dead one, man! That little<eol>cabron LaBonge! LaBonge set me up!<eos>
<bos>- Listen to me! Listen to me!<eol>- Billy LaBonge.<eos>
<bos>And the Amazing Maleeni. That's a<eol>double bill I wouldn't want to miss.<eos>
<bos>Pinchbeck. You made your bail.<eos>
<bos>You, too, LaBonge.<eos>
<bos>-  Okay.<eos>
<bos>Good morning, gentlemen.<eol>Did you sleep well?<eos>
<bos>Agent Mulder. Agent Scully.<eos>
<bos>- Bravo. Really. - What do you mean?<eos>
<bos>Last night the Cradock Marine Bank<eol>was robbed of $1.8 million.<eos>
<bos>This morning that<eol>entire amount was found...<eos>
<bos>in the possession of Mr. Cissy Alvarez.<eos>
<bos>Wow. I told you he was bad news.<eol>Bravo to you.<eos>
<bos>- It was expeditious police work.<eol>-  Well, thank you.<eos>
<bos>It was, wasn't it? It's only that<eol>Alvarez was so obviously guilty...<eos>
<bos>a convicted bank robber<eol>caught red-handed,<eos>
<bos>witnessed trying to rob an armored car<eol>just two days earlier?<eos>
<bos>- He'll need a good lawyer. - Yeah.<eos>
<bos>I don't quite see where<eol>you're headed with this.<eos>
<bos>I have no evidence,<eol>but I have a theory, Mr. Maleeni,<eos>
<bos>and, uh, I'll tell you how it goes.<eos>
<bos>I think that your twin brother Albert<eol>died of a heart attack,<eos>
<bos>at which point, you and your<eol>young protegee saw a golden opportunity.<eos>
<bos>My protegee? I hate this guy's guts.<eos>
<bos>That's what you wanted us to think.<eos>
<bos>You wanted revenge against the man who<eol>made your life in prison a living hell.<eos>
<bos>I did time with you<eol>about eight years ago.<eos>
<bos>Alvarez. You and he were on<eol>the same cell block eight years ago.<eos>
<bos>Which gave LaBonge an in with Alvarez<eol>once everybody thought you were dead.<eos>
<bos>LaBonge planted Alvarez's marker in<eol>Maleeni's van and made sure we found it.<eos>
<bos>And then you used Alvarez's greed<eol>in order to ensnare him,<eos>
<bos>and then orchestrated the attempted<eol>bank robbery in order to implicate him.<eos>
<bos>Yeah, that was you in the armored car<eol>disguised as Alvarez.<eos>
<bos>Somehow Mr. Pinchbeck got ahold of<eol>the guard's gun and switched the clip.<eos>
<bos>And then last night,<eol>the two of you robbed the bank...<eos>
<bos>and planted the money at Alvarez's place.<eos>
<bos>Don't you think we have<eol>pretty good alibis?<eos>
<bos>You have great alibis.<eol>You have the best alibis in the world,<eos>
<bos>which is why I think you two<eol>got arrested in the first place.<eos>
<bos>With your expertise in sleight of hand,<eol>pickpocketing and escapology,<eos>
<bos>I think you were both able to get out<eol>of here by pilfering a guard's key.<eos>
<bos>You could have escaped,<eol>stolen the money, framed Alvarez...<eos>
<bos>and been back here in time for breakfast.<eos>
<bos>Scrambled eggs and sausage.<eos>
<bos>That would be the world's<eol>greatest trick, wouldn't it?<eos>
<bos>One that would be forever remembered<eol>in the annals of magic.<eos>
<bos>- What happens to us? -  To you?<eos>
<bos>You go free, provided the magic is over.<eos>
<bos>The great ones always know<eol>when to leave the stage.<eos>
<bos>Billy, let's get the hell outta here.<eos>
<bos>- They are the world's greatest.<eol>- We saw through their magic.<eos>
<bos>Ah, there's more.<eos>
<bos>Behold.<eos>
<bos>- The Amazing Maleeni's wallet.<eol>- You picked his pocket?<eos>
<bos>No, I pilfered it from the evidence room<eol>to prevent them from completing...<eos>
<bos>their final act of prestidigitation.<eos>
<bos>- What are you talking about?<eol>- I began to wonder,<eos>
<bos>why did they need so elaborate a setup?<eos>
<bos>We were the last piece of the puzzle.<eos>
<bos>Yes. Framing Alvarez was<eol>just another misdirection.<eos>
<bos>This trick was about E.F.T. s,<eol>electronic fund transfers at the bank.<eos>
<bos>Maleeni, Pinchbeck, he didn't have<eol>security clearance for them,<eos>
<bos>so he needed a little federal law<eol>enforcement intervention...<eos>
<bos>specifically, my badge number...<eos>
<bos>and my thumbprint.<eos>
<bos>as to make that 1.8 million<eol>look like cigar-lighting money.<eos>
<bos>But they can't do it without this.<eos>
<bos>Pick a card, Scully. Any card.<eos>
<bos>You know, Mulder, there's still<eol>one thing that you haven't explained.<eos>
<bos>What's that?<eos>
<bos>How the Amazing Maleeni was able<eol>to turn his head completely around.<eos>
<bos>- I don't know that. - I do.<eos>
<bos>I'll show you. Observe.<eos>
<bos>Gee! Very nice. How'd you do that?<eos>
<bos>Well... magic.<eos>
<bos>No, seriously, Scully. How'd you do it?<eos>
<bos>You know, it's not the same thing.<eos>
<bos>Uh, it's different with the head.<eol>Come on, now. Look at this.<eos>
