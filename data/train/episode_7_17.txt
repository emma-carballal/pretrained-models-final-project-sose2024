<bos>Good afternoon.<eol>I hope we're not bothering you.<eos>
<bos>- I'm just waiting for a call.<eol>- We're all waiting, ma'am,<eos>
<bos>for the good Lord to call in his flock.<eos>
<bos>From the cable TV people.<eos>
<bos>I'm just moving in. God bless.<eos>
<bos>Good afternoon.<eol>I hope we're not bothering...<eos>
<bos>- Yes? - Y-You're...<eos>
<bos>- Weren't you...<eol>- Yeah, didn't we just...<eos>
<bos>- Didn't you just what? - Speak to you.<eos>
<bos>- What are you talking about?<eos>
<bos>Yeah, just down the street. She's<eol>just moving in. Your spitting image.<eos>
<bos>You're really not gonna believe it<eol>when you see her.<eos>
<bos>- Ma'am? - Go away! Get out of here!<eos>
<bos>Okay.<eos>
<bos>Betty Templeton?<eos>
<bos>- Yes? - We're with the F.B.I.<eos>
<bos>I just moved in yesterday. I don't<eol>know anything about any incident.<eos>
<bos>Well, we have two young men in the car<eol>who say you do know something.<eos>
<bos>Oh, my God!<eos>
<bos>Those were the boys that were<eol>here yesterday. What happened?<eos>
<bos>They were beaten to within<eol>an inch of their lives by each other...<eos>
<bos>after visiting the home<eol>of a woman living a few blocks over.<eos>
<bos>fits your description.<eos>
<bos>She, uh, lives around here?<eos>
<bos>Are you a practitioner<eol>of the occult, Miss Templeton?<eos>
<bos>Wicca, voodoo, Satanism,<eol>the black art of bodily bilocation?<eos>
<bos>Me? No.<eos>
<bos>You know what they say.<eos>
<bos>Everyone has a twin out there somewhere.<eos>
<bos>No, we don't know what they say.<eos>
<bos>We went over to the house,<eol>but it's empty. No one lives there.<eos>
<bos>Frankly, we're not even sure<eol>if she exists.<eos>
<bos>This is an F.B.I. fleet sedan...<eos>
<bos>driven into a tree at 43 miles an hour<eol>by the female agent...<eos>
<bos>in a novel effort<eol>to kill her male counterpart.<eos>
<bos>Now, you might think I'm gonna<eol>suggest psychokinesis, P. K...<eos>
<bos>someone or something controlling the<eol>agents with remote mind-bending power.<eos>
<bos>But it's not?<eos>
<bos>Both agents sustained critical injuries.<eol>Their stories eerily similar,<eos>
<bos>You may think that I'm gonna say<eol>it's past lives unresolved,<eos>
<bos>a fate stalking the agents<eol>like an animal.<eos>
<bos>- Seven years?<eol>- Yeah, but they are not...<eos>
<bos>romantically involved,<eol>if that's what you're thinking.<eos>
<bos>Not even I would be so farfetched.<eos>
<bos>You have any ideas, Scully? Any thoughts?<eos>
<bos>What I'm thinking, Mulder,<eol>is how familiar this seems.<eos>
<bos>Playing Watson to your Sherlock.<eos>
<bos>You dangling clues out<eol>in front of me one by one.<eos>
<bos>It's a game, and...<eos>
<bos>And as usual, you're holding<eol>something back from me.<eos>
<bos>You're not telling me<eol>something about this case.<eos>
<bos>Hmm?<eos>
<bos>Okay, so these agents<eol>were investigating something.<eos>
<bos>- Something much like...<eos>
<bos>what they themselves<eol>were almost killed by.<eos>
<bos>Uh, something they<eol>came into contact with.<eos>
<bos>Uh, third party.<eos>
<bos>Two third parties.<eos>
<bos>Twins?<eos>
<bos>Relatives?<eos>
<bos>Uh, doppelganger?<eos>
<bos>Uh, corporeal likeness...<eos>
<bos>that appears unbidden<eol>from the spirit world,<eos>
<bos>the sight of which<eol>presages one's own death.<eos>
<bos>Or... a double conjured into the world<eol>by a technique called bilocation,<eos>
<bos>which, in psychological terms,<eos>
<bos>represents the person's<eol>secret desires and impulses,<eos>
<bos>committing acts that a real person<eol>cannot commit himself...<eos>
<bos>or... herself.<eos>
<bos>Mulder, the slide, please.<eos>
<bos>Yes!<eos>
<bos>Don't go thinking I'm gonna<eol>start doing the autopsies.<eos>
<bos>Excuse me.<eos>
<bos>Hi. I applied for<eol>the sales job you posted.<eos>
<bos>Ah, yeah. I remember. How could I forget?<eos>
<bos>- As I recall, Miss... - Pfeiffer.<eos>
<bos>- Are you sure? - Lulu Pfeiffer, yes.<eos>
<bos>You reside at 15527 Morton Bay Street?<eos>
<bos>- Not any longer. I've moved.<eol>- You've moved?<eos>
<bos>Yes. And I don't have my new address yet.<eos>
<bos>Actually, Miss Pfeiffer,<eol>that's what's sending up the red flag.<eos>
<bos>You move a lot. And there's also<eol>your employment history.<eos>
<bos>Seventeen jobs in seventeen states<eol>in the past three years?<eos>
<bos>You seem to have as many jobs here<eol>as you have addresses.<eos>
<bos>I... I had a restless streak.<eos>
<bos>Well, the copy business<eol>takes a motivated person.<eos>
<bos>Oh, I'm an extremely versatile employee,<eol>as you can see by my resum√©.<eos>
<bos>What I can tell is you've<eol>left a variety of jobs.<eos>
<bos>"Mongolian barbecue chef,<eol>high-rise window washer,<eos>
<bos>- Wild animal trainer, palm reader."<eos>
<bos>- Yes, but I am on a career path now.<eol>- Hey! What's going on here?<eos>
<bos>- Yes, but I am on a career path now.<eol>- Hey! What's going on here?<eos>
<bos>- All my copies are black.<eol>- My machine's going crazy.<eos>
<bos>Who's running this place?<eos>
<bos>I can start you immediately. There's a<eol>clean uniform in the employee washroom.<eos>
<bos>- Oh, God.<eol>- Here. Over here. Oh, that's great.<eos>
<bos>- Can you help me turn this thing off?<eos>
<bos>My only copy!<eos>
<bos>That's quite a string of positions<eol>you've had, Miss... Templeton.<eos>
<bos>Seventeen jobs in the last three years.<eos>
<bos>I would've listed more, but there<eol>wasn't any room left on your form.<eos>
<bos>Seventeen's plenty, believe me.<eos>
<bos>It's not your references.<eol>It's the jobs themselves.<eos>
<bos>"Mongolian barbecue chef,<eol>high-rise window washer.<eos>
<bos>Wild animal trainer?"<eos>
<bos>I'm a highly versatile employee.<eos>
<bos>What guarantee do I have that you<eol>won't just up and quit tomorrow?<eos>
<bos>You have my personal word on it.<eol>I'm here in Kansas City to stay.<eos>
<bos>- Who is it?<eos>
<bos>Mr. Zupanic, it's the F.B.I.<eos>
<bos>- Excuse me?<eol>- It's the F.B.I., Mr. Zupanic.<eos>
<bos>- Open up. - Give me a minute.<eos>
<bos>- Bert Zupanic? - Yeah?<eos>
<bos>We're hoping you could help us<eol>find the whereabouts...<eos>
<bos>of a woman we think<eol>you're familiar with...<eos>
<bos>a Betty Templeton.<eos>
<bos>I don't know no Betty Templeton.<eos>
<bos>Maybe you should take another look<eol>at that photograph, Mr. Zupanic.<eos>
<bos>Five foot three, red hair.<eos>
<bos>Maybe I can jog your memory.<eos>
<bos>Are you still pleading<eol>ignorance, Mr. Zupanic?<eos>
<bos>Is that not you in last year's<eol>Fourth ofJuly parade?<eos>
<bos>- Yeah.<eol>- Then who's that sitting next to you?<eos>
<bos>- Her. - Try Betty Templeton.<eos>
<bos>We can't find her, Mr. Zupanic.<eol>She seems to have left town in a hurry.<eos>
<bos>- She did? - Mm-hmm.<eos>
<bos>And didn't she used to live<eol>on Morton Bay in a pink house?<eos>
<bos>- Alderwood, blue house. - On Alderwood?<eos>
<bos>Mr. Zupanic, do you have<eol>any reason to be lying to us?<eos>
<bos>No, sir... I mean, ma'am.<eos>
<bos>Thank you, Mr. Zupanic. I have no doubt<eol>we'll be in touch with you.<eos>
<bos>and where we can find her, but that<eol>he is hip to whatever she's into,<eos>
<bos>and I should take a look at that house<eol>he mentioned on Morton Bay Street...<eos>
<bos>while you go and find out<eol>from Mr. Zupanic what it is exactly...<eos>
<bos>that he's clearly hiding<eol>about Betty Templeton.<eos>
<bos>I'm thinking that Bert Zupanic really<eol>truly doesn't know Betty Templeton.<eos>
<bos>Well, I guess that's why<eol>they put the "l" in the F.B.I.<eos>
<bos>I'm gonna be standin'on the corner<eos>
<bos>12th Street and Vine<eos>
<bos>I'm gonna be standin' on the corner<eos>
<bos>12th Street and Vine<eos>
<bos>Give me a double, Freddy.<eos>
<bos>I thought you were in training,<eol>Bert, my man.<eos>
<bos>- Would you just pour? - All right.<eos>
<bos>Well, I might take a train<eos>
<bos>I might take a plane<eol>but if I have to walk<eos>
<bos>I'm goin'just the same<eos>
<bos>I'm goin'to Kansas City<eos>
<bos>Kansas City, here I come<eos>
<bos>Nice outfit.<eos>
<bos>Freddy, fire in the hole.<eos>
<bos>Seven and Seven for the lady,<eol>and make it stiff.<eos>
<bos>Oh, my God! How did you do that?<eos>
<bos>- Do what? - How did you know my drink?<eos>
<bos>I feel like you're looking<eol>right through me,<eos>
<bos>like you're reading my soul like a book.<eos>
<bos>Maybe you've had enough of the vodka.<eos>
<bos>- You are in trouble, aren't you?<eol>- I don't know.<eos>
<bos>I could be.<eos>
<bos>What kind of trouble are you looking for?<eos>
<bos>You don't want to go home tonight, okay?<eos>
<bos>It just so happens<eol>I don't got a home to go to.<eos>
<bos>Anyway, I'm Betty Templeton.<eos>
<bos>Alderwood Avenue.<eos>
<bos>- My God.<eos>
<bos>I'm shaking.<eos>
<bos>Oh... Oh, that's perfect.<eos>
<bos>Hey.<eos>
<bos>Hey, Scully!<eos>
<bos>I want you to meet a buddy of mine,<eol>Mr. Argyle "Sapersteen."<eos>
<bos>- "Stein." - Saperstein. Excuse me.<eos>
<bos>- This is my partner, Dana Scully.<eos>
<bos>Pleasure and an honor.<eos>
<bos>So, uh, I take it from your posture,<eol>Mulder, you've solved this case.<eos>
<bos>Not solved it, but I have narrowed<eol>down the search for our perpetrator...<eos>
<bos>with the kind help<eol>of Mr. Saperstein here.<eos>
<bos>- Narrowed it down to where?<eol>- Right down there.<eos>
<bos>Our mystery woman is indeed<eol>involved with Mr. Bert Zupanic,<eos>
<bos>the man we spoke to at his hotel,<eos>
<bos>If it's the lady I'm thinking,<eol>she's not much to look at,<eos>
<bos>but he says she brings him luck.<eos>
<bos>- Bert Zupanic is a boxer?<eol>- A wrestler, semipro.<eos>
<bos>Well, there's lots to do here<eol>and the barbecue's second to none.<eos>
<bos>Right, Mr. Saperstein? Plus,<eol>Mr. Saperstein was gonna show me...<eos>
<bos>on the American pop culture, right?<eos>
<bos>Unless, of course,<eol>you've already found Betty Templeton.<eos>
<bos>Finding Betty Templeton<eol>won't solve this case, Mulder.<eos>
<bos>Not unless we find Lulu Pfeiffer.<eos>
<bos>- Who's Lulu Pfeiffer?<eol>- Our doppelganger...<eos>
<bos>who lived, until yesterday,<eol>in a pink house on Morton Bay Street.<eos>
<bos>But she's not a manifestation,<eol>Mulder. She's real...<eos>
<bos>and so is the path of destruction<eol>that she's left in her wake.<eos>
<bos>Though there seems to be no connection<eol>of any kind between these two women,<eos>
<bos>Betty Templeton and Lulu Pfeiffer...<eos>
<bos>have traveled city to city<eol>across 17 U.S. states,<eos>
<bos>one alternately trailing<eol>the other for the past 12 years.<eos>
<bos>It's not just car accidents<eol>and fistfights, Mulder.<eos>
<bos>- Sholom Aleichem. - Yeah. Your mama.<eos>
<bos>- Hello. - Where's my money?<eos>
<bos>I got it, and I'm bringing it.<eos>
<bos>Yeah, that's what I heard last night.<eol>Now you got the feds on your ass.<eos>
<bos>Maybe I should cancel the fight.<eos>
<bos>I'm bringing the money, okay?<eol>I'm bringing it!<eos>
<bos>I'm having lunch at Froggy's.<eol>No money, no fight, Titanic.<eos>
<bos>- In trouble or something?<eol>- I'm just, uh...<eos>
<bos>I gotta be somewhere, okay?<eos>
<bos>Why? What time is it?<eol>Oh, God, I'm gonna be late for work!<eos>
<bos>You were incredible.<eos>
<bos>Why do I find myself so wildly attracted<eol>to you, Bert Zupanic?<eos>
<bos>You just can't help yourself, baby.<eos>
<bos>Where were you last night?<eos>
<bos>- Where was I? - Yeah.<eos>
<bos>- Well, I...<eol>- You said, "Meet me for a drink."<eos>
<bos>- That's what you said.<eos>
<bos>I was there, and I-I was waiting on you.<eos>
<bos>- Who is she? - "Who is she?"<eos>
<bos>You do not wanna get in the ring<eol>with me, mister!<eos>
<bos>Honey, listen... Come on, baby.<eol>There's nobody under there.<eos>
<bos>- You're acting crazy, sweetie.<eol>- I'm gonna look under every single...<eos>
<bos>Hey! I know this hairpin.<eos>
<bos>Oh, I-I can explain that.<eos>
<bos>You lovable lug, Bert Zupanic!<eos>
<bos>I'm sorry, baby. This is mine.<eos>
<bos>- Of course it is.<eol>- I just get so jealous.<eos>
<bos>- You forgive me? - I forgive you.<eos>
<bos>- Will you call me at least? Bye.<eol>- You bet. I'm on the phone now, okay?<eos>
<bos>- Bert, did I hear voices?<eos>
<bos>- Voices? I didn't hear any voices.<eos>
<bos>Oh!<eos>
<bos>Oh.<eos>
<bos>Where's the Titanic?<eos>
<bos>What?<eos>
<bos>Your boyfriend, the wrestler.<eos>
<bos>Wow, talk about moves.<eos>
<bos>I can't believe that we barely just met.<eos>
<bos>He's supposed to meet me here.<eos>
<bos>He's coming here?<eos>
<bos>He'd better be if he wants<eol>that fight Saturday night.<eos>
<bos>I'd better go freshen up a little.<eol>I was just coming in for lunch.<eos>
<bos>Zupanic, hey.<eos>
<bos>Thought you were a no-show.<eol>Talking to your girlfriend.<eos>
<bos>- My girlfriend?<eos>
<bos>Holy shoot!<eos>
<bos>What is that?<eos>
<bos>- Now, how did she do that? - Do what?<eos>
<bos>I just saw her. I swear.<eol>I just saw her go to the can.<eos>
<bos>- She just went to the can?<eol>- Ten seconds ago.<eos>
<bos>- What are you doing here?<eol>- I have a business meeting.<eos>
<bos>Why don't I meet you outside in the park?<eos>
<bos>- I was just gonna get some lunch.<eol>- Perfect.<eos>
<bos>- We'll have a picnic.<eol>- A picnic? We never do that.<eos>
<bos>- Oh, yeah.<eos>
<bos>Now...<eos>
<bos>- Bert?<eos>
<bos>I have a little business<eol>to attend to, sweetie.<eos>
<bos>- You got more than that to attend to.<eol>- Hey, Bert, I only got an hou...<eos>
<bos>Mr. Zupanic?<eos>
<bos>What happened?<eos>
<bos>Uh, there was an incident.<eos>
<bos>You were struck by flying glass.<eos>
<bos>Did you lose something?<eos>
<bos>Yeah. My good luck.<eos>
<bos>Would that be Betty or Lulu, Mr. Zupanic?<eos>
<bos>Where are they, Mr. Zupanic?<eos>
<bos>Excuse me.<eos>
<bos>- F.B.I. - Can I help you?<eos>
<bos>Yes, I'm looking for... that girl.<eos>
<bos>Betty. This man's from the F.B.I.<eos>
<bos>I think we both know why I'm here.<eos>
<bos>- It's her fault! - Lulu Pfeiffer.<eos>
<bos>She follows me around<eol>trying to ruin my life.<eos>
<bos>I'm not gonna let her ruin it this time.<eol>It's either me or her.<eos>
<bos>I don't want to leave Kansas.<eos>
<bos>- Scully. - Hey, Scully.<eos>
<bos>I found her at Koko's Copy Center.<eos>
<bos>- Betty Templeton? - Yeah.<eos>
<bos>She says that Lulu Pfeiffer's<eol>trying to ruin her life.<eos>
<bos>- Follows her wherever she goes.<eol>- Lulu Pfeiffer works at Koko's too.<eos>
<bos>That's exactly what<eol>Lulu says about Betty,<eos>
<bos>except she says this is the end of<eol>the line, that she's not leaving Kansas.<eos>
<bos>- That's exactly what Betty said.<eol>- What's going on here?<eos>
<bos>I don't know, Scully. You're running<eol>this show. Why don't you tell me?<eos>
<bos>I think that this is more than<eol>just physical proximity, Mulder.<eos>
<bos>I think that these women have some kind<eol>of a psychic connection.<eos>
<bos>- No...  Sherlock.<eos>
<bos>Hey, Scully, uh, where's Lulu?<eos>
<bos>She just took off, Mulder.<eol>She left work, and she drove away.<eos>
<bos>She wouldn't be driving<eol>a little blue convertible, would she?<eos>
<bos>That's exactly what she's driving.<eos>
<bos>Oh, crap.<eos>
<bos>- Can I help you? - Uh, yes.<eos>
<bos>I'm looking for someone.<eol>He was here speaking to an employee,<eos>
<bos>and I can't seem to reach him.<eos>
<bos>- Tall guy, dark hair? He left. - Yeah.<eos>
<bos>- And you don't know where he went?<eol>- Couldn't say.<eos>
<bos>- Okay. - However, I can tell you...<eos>
<bos>we have a two-for-one<eol>copy discount in effect.<eos>
<bos>- How about Internet access?<eol>- Right this way.<eos>
<bos>- Is he in there? - Yeah. Sleeping.<eos>
<bos>- Can you wake him up for me?<eol>- You sure you wanna do that?<eos>
<bos>- It's important.<eol>- Will you two shut up or go away?<eos>
<bos>Mr. Damfuse?<eos>
<bos>The sound of your voice<eol>is like a jackhammer on my eardrums!<eos>
<bos>Mr. Damfuse, I'm Special Agent<eol>Dana Scully with the F.B.I.<eos>
<bos>What's so special about you?<eos>
<bos>It's an F.B. I title, sir.<eos>
<bos>I know it is. I'm not stupid!<eos>
<bos>Mr. Damfuse, if you'll<eol>let me explain why I'm here,<eos>
<bos>we might be able to get you<eol>to bed a little bit sooner.<eos>
<bos>Ah! What a relief!<eos>
<bos>Mr. Damfuse, through a lot<eol>of matching up of documents...<eos>
<bos>that I have been able<eol>to compile on the Internet...<eos>
<bos>and by comparing time and space<eol>and circumstance...<eos>
<bos>and by liberally applying<eol>the law of averages...<eos>
<bos>They could electrocute me quicker!<eos>
<bos>I believe that you may be<eol>the father of two daughters.<eos>
<bos>I'm no father!<eos>
<bos>Using documents filed by a sperm bank<eol>in Sparta, Illinois...<eos>
<bos>and by the mothers who may have been<eol>impregnated by your donation...<eos>
<bos>I Yankee Doodled into a plastic cup!<eos>
<bos>And it is very important for their<eol>safety and for the safety of others...<eos>
<bos>and anything about your family tree<eol>that may be able to explain...<eos>
<bos>the reactions that are being caused<eol>by these two girls.<eos>
<bos>A big ugly dog lifted its leg<eol>on my family tree!<eos>
<bos>Make room for Daddy.<eos>
<bos>Shut up, you fat ox!<eos>
<bos>- Oh. - You aren't answering your phone?<eos>
<bos>I'm just screening my calls.<eos>
<bos>You sleep with me once<eol>and now you're avoiding me?<eos>
<bos>I got... big trouble, baby.<eos>
<bos>I got just one shot left<eol>for the big time. Just one.<eos>
<bos>But you got your match tonight.<eol>Your name's up on the marquee.<eos>
<bos>I've lost my financing.<eos>
<bos>- You're my good luck, baby. - I am?<eos>
<bos>It was my good luck to meet you.<eos>
<bos>And if you could just...<eos>
<bos>They say I'm old, I'm washed up.<eos>
<bos>All I want's a shot.<eos>
<bos>If I don't get the money,<eol>I'm gonna lose my chance.<eos>
<bos>Maybe I can.<eos>
<bos>You're not answering your phone?<eos>
<bos>Lulu?<eos>
<bos>Someone else you were expecting? Well?<eos>
<bos>Baby, I got trouble. I got big trouble.<eos>
<bos>- Mulder?<eos>
<bos>- Yeah. - Where have you been?<eos>
<bos>Seeing a side of Kansas City<eol>few men have the privilege to see.<eos>
<bos>- What happened to you?<eol>- I got sucked into a storm drain.<eos>
<bos>I don't know, but I have been able to<eol>locate the nature of their connection.<eos>
<bos>Both women are nonfraternal siblings<eol>from the same father.<eos>
<bos>- You've located him?<eol>- Yeah. He's here in the state pen.<eos>
<bos>When is all this yammering gonna stop?<eos>
<bos>And he's given you insight?<eos>
<bos>Well, the biggest thing that<eol>I can figure out right now...<eos>
<bos>is he's probably the angriest<eol>man in the world, Mulder.<eos>
<bos>Not as angry as those<eol>two women are gonna be...<eos>
<bos>when they both realize they're in love<eol>with the one and only Bert Zupanic.<eos>
<bos>- They're both after him?<eol>- They're both in love with him.<eos>
<bos>That's why they're both staying<eol>in Kansas City and they won't leave.<eos>
<bos>Well, if they're the reason,<eol>it doesn't explain what's happening,<eos>
<bos>what's causing this phenomenon<eol>or how we're gonna make it stop.<eos>
<bos>I don't know. You're the one who's<eol>supposed to have all the answers.<eos>
<bos>Somebody's got to get to that fight<eol>and keep those two women apart,<eos>
<bos>or else this time the...<eol>is going to hit the fans.<eos>
<bos>Well, hi.<eos>
<bos>Mr. Zupanic?<eos>
<bos>- Goin'to Kansas City<eos>
<bos>Kansas City, here I come<eos>
<bos>Goin'to Kansas City<eos>
<bos>Kansas City, here I come<eos>
<bos>- You said you'd have my money.<eos>
<bos>I'll have it. I swear I will.<eos>
<bos>I'll call off the damn fight, Titanic.<eos>
<bos>I'll have these people<eol>cursing your very name!<eos>
<bos>I'm telling you it'll be here.<eos>
<bos>Don't worry. I promise.<eos>
<bos>Bert!<eos>
<bos>Bert, I got it.<eos>
<bos>How about ya, buddy?<eos>
<bos>Let's get ready to rumble.<eos>
<bos>Oh, baby, I knew you<eol>wouldn't let me down.<eos>
<bos>It's you and me... all the way.<eos>
<bos>- Yeah!<eos>
<bos>Ladies and gentlemen,<eos>
<bos>get out your seats and on your feets...<eos>
<bos>for our own hometown boy,<eos>
<bos>Whoo!<eos>
<bos>Bert "the Titanic"...<eos>
<bos>Zupanic!<eos>
<bos>- Go, Titanic! - Oh! Oh, yeah!<eos>
<bos>Let's take him, baby!<eol>Let's take him, baby!<eos>
<bos>Whoo!<eos>
<bos>- Whoo!<eos>
<bos>Come on!<eos>
<bos>-  Titanic!<eos>
<bos>Oh, yeah! Come on!<eos>
<bos>Whoo-hoo! Go, Titanic!<eos>
<bos>You can do it, Titanic!<eos>
<bos>Betty Templeton.<eos>
<bos>My name is Fox Mulder. I'm with<eol>the F.B.I. Can you come with me?<eos>
<bos>I'm watching the fight!<eos>
<bos>Don't make me have to remove you, ma'am.<eos>
<bos>I can't believe this.<eos>
<bos>What are you doing here?<eos>
<bos>What are you doing here?<eol>I'm Bert's good luck.<eos>
<bos>- He's mine! - Over my dead body!<eos>
<bos>Stop it! Stop it!<eol>You're going down, lady!<eos>
<bos>I'm gonna kick your butt<eol>from here till Tuesday!<eos>
<bos>Stick a fork in you!<eol>You're done! Hi, baby.<eos>
<bos>- Betty?<eol>- Bert, keep it up. I love you, baby!<eos>
<bos>- Bert, I got the money. - Lulu?<eos>
<bos>Kick his butt, Bert.<eos>
<bos>-  Lulu!<eos>
<bos>No! Bert!<eos>
<bos>Oh, my.<eos>
<bos>Oh, my God!<eos>
<bos>What?<eos>
<bos>Why...<eos>
<bos>Fifty million anonymous donations...<eos>
<bos>have been made to sperm banks<eol>across the U.S.<eos>
<bos>Most have produced healthy offspring<eol>for single mothers...<eos>
<bos>or fertility-challenged couples<eol>while some of them have not.<eos>
<bos>Bert Zupanic and his nonfraternal<eol>biological sibling...<eos>
<bos>both small-time bank robbers,<eol>part-time pro wrestlers,<eos>
<bos>both with too many idiosyncratic<eol>behaviorisms to list...<eos>
<bos>stood a 27-million-to-one chance<eol>of ever meeting,<eos>
<bos>but they did.<eos>
<bos>Damn, those are some odds.<eos>
<bos>Betty Templeton and Lulu Pfeiffer...<eos>
<bos>products of different mothers<eol>but the same father,<eos>
<bos>an angry drifter now doing time<eol>for counterfeiting...<eos>
<bos>chanced to meet 12 years ago,<eos>
<bos>but couldn't seem to avoid each other's<eol>compulsively identical mannerisms...<eos>
<bos>mannerisms attributable to<eol>their perpetually angry father.<eos>
<bos>Hmm. What does it all mean?<eos>
<bos>I've been thinking hard<eol>about that, Mr. Saperstein.<eos>
<bos>I would like to say it has something<eol>to do with balance in the universe...<eos>
<bos>the attraction of opposites<eol>and the repulsion of equivalents.<eos>
<bos>Or, that over time, nature produces<eol>only so many originals...<eos>
<bos>that when two original copies meet,<eol>that the result is often unpredictable.<eos>
<bos>If four should meet, the result is...<eos>
<bos>Well, suffice to say,<eos>
<bos>it's betterjust to avoid<eol>these encounters altogether...<eos>
<bos>and at all costs.<eos>
<bos>I think Agent Mulder would agree with me.<eos>
<bos>Uh-huh.<eos>
