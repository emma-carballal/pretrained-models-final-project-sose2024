<bos>God's love will set us free.<eos>
<bos>And I believe...<eos>
<bos>if I pray for that love,<eos>
<bos>if I get down on my knees...<eos>
<bos>and allow God to enter my hardened,<eol>lonely, miserable heart...<eos>
<bos>and change me through and through,<eos>
<bos>that miracle... will come.<eos>
<bos>Now, who here believes that with me?<eos>
<bos>Do you?<eos>
<bos>- Do you? - Yes, sir, I believe it.<eos>
<bos>Do you?<eos>
<bos>Well, believe, because God's<eol>love is not just some slogan.<eos>
<bos>It's a promise...<eos>
<bos>straight to you from<eol>the Lord Almighty himself.<eos>
<bos>A promise paid for with the<eol>blood of His only begotten Son,<eos>
<bos>Jesus Christ of Nazareth.<eos>
<bos>All you have to do is believe.<eos>
<bos>-  Amen! - God's love will set you free.<eos>
<bos>Now doesn't that<eol>just lift up your heart...<eos>
<bos>and make you want to say, "Glory! Amen!"<eos>
<bos>Glory! Amen!<eos>
<bos>Join with me.<eol>Allow the spirit ofJesus Christ...<eos>
<bos>to show you the way<eol>up to our Heavenly Father.<eos>
<bos>- Glory! Amen! - Glory! Amen!<eos>
<bos>Let God's love<eol>free you from your prison...<eos>
<bos>and deliver you to His side in heaven.<eos>
<bos>- Glory! Amen! - Glory! Amen!<eos>
<bos>Praise His name. Praise His holy love.<eos>
<bos>- Glory! Amen! - Glory! Amen!<eos>
<bos>- Glory! Amen! - Glory! Amen!<eos>
<bos>- Glory! Amen! - Glory! Amen!<eos>
<bos>Glory! Amen!<eos>
<bos>Glory! Amen!<eos>
<bos>Glory! Amen!<eos>
<bos>Glory! Amen!<eos>
<bos>Glory! Amen!<eos>
<bos>Glory! Amen!<eos>
<bos>Do you believe that, Donny?<eol>That God loves a sack of crap like you?<eos>
<bos>you get to burn in hell.<eos>
<bos>- Glory. Amen. Glory. Amen.<eol>- You listening to me?<eos>
<bos>God's got a place for you,<eol>all right, you sick puke.<eos>
<bos>Then where's that leave you?<eos>
<bos>Sorry. It's not good enough<eol>for the Illinois penal system.<eos>
<bos>My hands! My hands!<eos>
<bos>Life without chance of parole...<eos>
<bos>for the premeditated<eol>and sadistic sexual murders...<eos>
<bos>of five Twin Cities women in 1994.<eos>
<bos>Donald Addy Faster.<eos>
<bos>You two put this man away.<eos>
<bos>Yeah. Someone forgot<eol>to throw away the key.<eos>
<bos>That's another story.<eos>
<bos>Right now we have to apprehend this man.<eos>
<bos>Donny Faster is a death fetishist...<eos>
<bos>a collector of bone<eol>and dead flesh, of toenails and hair.<eos>
<bos>It's what floats his boat, gets him off.<eos>
<bos>- He's a sick man.<eol>- Sick would describe him.<eos>
<bos>- So it's just women he's after.<eol>- Just women.<eos>
<bos>I happen to know you two agents<eol>have a particular forte,<eos>
<bos>a thing for... what is it called...<eol>the supernatural?<eos>
<bos>Now, the circumstances of the escape...<eos>
<bos>I promise you there is nothing<eol>supernatural about this man.<eos>
<bos>Donny Faster is just plain evil.<eos>
<bos>Case closed.<eos>
<bos>You didn't look at the file, did you?<eos>
<bos>A man escaped from prison.<eos>
<bos>Not a man. Donny Faster.<eos>
<bos>He didn't just escape. He walked out.<eos>
<bos>- Isn't that why we're here?<eol>- That's why I'm here.<eos>
<bos>I don't know about you. Why are you here?<eos>
<bos>- Go home, Scully.<eol>- Mulder, this case doesn't bother me.<eos>
<bos>The man abducted you.<eos>
<bos>Donny Faster did a number on your head<eol>like I've never seen.<eos>
<bos>And it's okay to... walk away.<eos>
<bos>It's not a question of if I should stay.<eol>I don't have a choice.<eos>
<bos>So let's get to work.<eos>
<bos>Well, this isn't the first incident.<eos>
<bos>Two prisoners have escaped<eol>from maximum security facilities...<eos>
<bos>in neighboring states over the past year.<eos>
<bos>At 6:06 this morning,<eol>Donny Faster made it three.<eos>
<bos>6:06?<eos>
<bos>And what's so supernatural about that?<eos>
<bos>Dozens of witnesses, guards and staff<eol>and no one seems to remember anything.<eos>
<bos>For a while they didn't even know<eol>these guys were missing.<eos>
<bos>I'm a Christian, man.<eos>
<bos>Then I know you'll tell me the truth.<eos>
<bos>Yeah. But I got no idea<eol>about Donny Faster...<eos>
<bos>or how he broke out.<eos>
<bos>Well, it wasn't just me.<eol>There was a lot of us in the shop.<eos>
<bos>Yeah, but you had something happen.<eol>You had an incident.<eos>
<bos>Yeah, something like that.<eos>
<bos>You cried out to the guards<eol>that you'd cut your hands.<eos>
<bos>My fingers, man. I saw them all cut off.<eos>
<bos>- Others saw them too.<eol>- No, but I felt them cut off.<eos>
<bos>How do you explain that?<eos>
<bos>God works in mysterious ways, brother.<eos>
<bos>- Glory. Amen.<eos>
<bos>Glory. Amen.<eos>
<bos>Glory.<eos>
<bos>Amen.<eos>
<bos>Posthypnotic suggestion. Did you see him?<eos>
<bos>You mean did I see him raise his foot?<eol>Yes, I saw that.<eos>
<bos>Programmed behavior prompted<eol>and manifested by suggestion.<eos>
<bos>In this case, a rhythmic motion<eol>of the hands...<eos>
<bos>producing an unconscious act<eol>in a conscious state.<eos>
<bos>It doesn't work on you.<eos>
<bos>- I know what hypnosis is, Mulder.<eol>- Group hypnosis.<eos>
<bos>If you're suggesting that Donny Faster<eol>escaped from prison...<eos>
<bos>using a technique from<eol>a Vegas lounge act, I'd think again.<eos>
<bos>Messmer was able to hypnotize<eol>and command entire audiences.<eos>
<bos>So, how would Donny have<eol>acquired this amazing ability?<eos>
<bos>- I'm not saying that it was Donny.<eol>- Well, then who?<eos>
<bos>Three inmates are missing<eol>from three separate prisons.<eos>
<bos>One man has had possible contact<eol>with each of those cons.<eos>
<bos>The prison chaplain. Glory. Amen.<eos>
<bos>- Not God. The chaplain.<eos>
<bos>Scully, what?<eos>
<bos>That song, can you hear that?<eos>
<bos>Barely.<eos>
<bos>Well, I think if it was a make-out song,<eol>I think it'd be ruined forever now, huh?<eos>
<bos>Oh, girl, don't look any further<eos>
<bos>Looking for something to eat?<eos>
<bos>Me?<eos>
<bos>How 'bout... today's special?<eos>
<bos>- You aren't a narc, are you? - No.<eos>
<bos>- You're looking at my hands.<eol>- You need a buff and polish.<eos>
<bos>What are you, a freak?<eos>
<bos>I-I just got out of prison.<eos>
<bos>Hey, missy, leave the customers alone!<eos>
<bos>Hey, missy, leave the customers alone!<eos>
<bos>I'll do it for free.<eos>
<bos>You just got out of prison<eol>and you wanna give me a manicure?<eos>
<bos>I'll even do your cuticles.<eos>
<bos>You receive the<eol>Lord's grace, and this is your thanks.<eos>
<bos>- What?<eol>- Who do you think got you out of prison?<eos>
<bos>I don't care. I'm busy right now.<eos>
<bos>The grace of God got you out.<eos>
<bos>And it's the only thing<eol>that will keep you out.<eos>
<bos>- I thought you were kidding.<eol>- He's chosen you, Donny.<eos>
<bos>Later.<eos>
<bos>- You called them on me. - No.<eos>
<bos>Then do something.<eos>
<bos>I have a car.<eos>
<bos>- We aren't going to make it to the car.<eol>- It's within his power.<eos>
<bos>Glory. Amen.<eos>
<bos>- Glory. Amen.<eos>
<bos>- Is he here? - Well, uh...<eos>
<bos>We're trying to determine that.<eos>
<bos>Did you see him?<eos>
<bos>We got a call about<eol>a possible sighting of the suspect.<eos>
<bos>- Something happened here, huh?<eol>-  Guy got hit by a car.<eos>
<bos>Prison chaplain, it turns out.<eos>
<bos>- A Reverend Orison.<eos>
<bos>Paramedics took him to the hospital.<eol>He's in pretty bad shape.<eos>
<bos>Excuse me. Could you<eol>turn that up, please?<eos>
<bos>- Yeah. - What you need is a lover<eos>
<bos>Someone to take over<eos>
<bos>Oh, girl Don't look any further<eos>
<bos>And it's strange<eos>
<bos>When you think of the chances<eos>
<bos>You're lucky to be alive, Rev. Orison.<eos>
<bos>- Who are you?<eol>- Special Agent Dana Scully.<eos>
<bos>Believe in the Lord, Agent Scully.<eol>He believes in you.<eos>
<bos>That's nice. But my partner and I<eol>are more concerned...<eos>
<bos>Don't be concerned. God has them.<eos>
<bos>What do you mean?<eos>
<bos>- Reverend?<eol>- You're a believer, aren't you?<eos>
<bos>- This has nothing to do with me, sir.<eol>- Has everything to do with you.<eos>
<bos>You have faith. Have had faith.<eos>
<bos>You hear Him calling you,<eos>
<bos>but you're unsure of what to do.<eos>
<bos>It's not exactly a long shot, sir.<eos>
<bos>You stand as you do now,<eos>
<bos>neither here nor there, longing,<eos>
<bos>but afraid, waiting for a sign.<eos>
<bos>Well, the signs are everywhere.<eos>
<bos>What happened to the inmates, sir?<eos>
<bos>Everything has a reason, Scout...<eos>
<bos>everything on God's earth.<eos>
<bos>Every moment of every day...<eos>
<bos>the devil waits for but an instant.<eos>
<bos>As it is, it has always been,<eos>
<bos>the devil's instant is our eternity.<eos>
<bos>The good reverend. How do you do?<eos>
<bos>Or maybe I should say, how do you do it?<eos>
<bos>His is the word.<eos>
<bos>I am but the messenger who delivers it.<eos>
<bos>- Well, this delivery<eol>arrived a little late.<eos>
<bos>A little late and a little cold,<eos>
<bos>as a matter of fact.<eos>
<bos>I thought you'd want to see it.<eos>
<bos>What is this?<eos>
<bos>Blood of the lamb, Reverend.<eos>
<bos>The handiwork of Mr. Donny Faster.<eos>
<bos>Where is he, Reverend?<eos>
<bos>He took my car.<eos>
<bos>She wasn't supposed to die.<eos>
<bos>No, Donny was supposed to die.<eos>
<bos>You were supposed to kill him.<eos>
<bos>That's why you freed him.<eos>
<bos>God knows you're capable of it.<eos>
<bos>Rev. Orison is really<eol>Robert Gailen Orison,<eos>
<bos>convicted in 1959 of first degree murder.<eos>
<bos>Served 22 years in Solidad.<eos>
<bos>God spoke to me.<eos>
<bos>He told me to look after Donny.<eos>
<bos>When God spoke to you, Reverend,<eos>
<bos>did He happen to mention<eol>where Donny was headed?<eos>
<bos>- Where are you going, Mulder?<eol>- To prove that man's a liar.<eos>
<bos>How do you prove that somebody<eol>isn't being directed by God?<eos>
<bos>You don't believe that it happened?<eos>
<bos>God is a spectator, Scully.<eol>He just reads the box scores.<eos>
<bos>So, what? You think God directs him to...<eos>
<bos>let the prisoners out to kill?<eos>
<bos>No, but I believe that the reverend<eol>believes what's he's saying...<eos>
<bos>that it's God working through him.<eos>
<bos>Well, plenty of nut bags do.<eos>
<bos>Has He ever spoken to you?<eos>
<bos>I'm trying not to take offense.<eos>
<bos>What did He say?<eos>
<bos>Mulder, I have heard<eol>that song three times now.<eos>
<bos>That may not mean anything to you,<eol>but it means something to me.<eos>
<bos>- What does it mean?<eol>- I never thought about it before.<eos>
<bos>What?<eos>
<bos>When I was 13, my father<eol>was stationed in San Diego.<eos>
<bos>I was listening to the radio<eol>to that song...<eos>
<bos>when my mother came in and told me that<eol>my Sunday schoolteacher had been killed.<eos>
<bos>- Mmm.<eol>- He'd been murdered in his front yard.<eos>
<bos>And that's the first time I ever felt<eol>there was real evil in the world.<eos>
<bos>Mulder, Rev. Orison called me "Scout."<eos>
<bos>That's the same name<eol>my Sunday schoolteacher called me.<eos>
<bos>Donny Faster escaped<eol>from prison at 6:06 a.m.<eos>
<bos>So, what do you think<eol>that God is telling you?<eos>
<bos>Police are<eol>involved in a four-state manhunt...<eos>
<bos>for a prisoner who escaped<eol>maximum security in Marion, Illinois.<eos>
<bos>He was last seen driving a green 1970...<eos>
<bos>Chevrolet Impala with a black landau top.<eos>
<bos>He is described as<eol>six feet tall, medium build...<eos>
<bos>It's a cerebral edema.<eos>
<bos>A swelling of the brain.<eos>
<bos>A trauma not uncommon with<eol>this kind of head injury or accident.<eos>
<bos>Except this isn't accidental.<eos>
<bos>The cause, in fact, as it was stated<eol>to me, is self-inflicted.<eos>
<bos>There's a small hole here in the skull...<eos>
<bos>which allows oxygen<eol>into the brain cavity.<eos>
<bos>pumping through his brain.<eos>
<bos>- And he did this himself? - Yeah.<eos>
<bos>My guess is he probably did it<eol>when he first got into prison...<eos>
<bos>when he first learned<eol>how to use its powers.<eos>
<bos>- "Its powers"? - There's a theory...<eos>
<bos>that at this point in human evolution<eol>our mental capabilities...<eos>
<bos>are limited only by<eol>inadequate blood supply.<eos>
<bos>In fact, centuries ago<eol>in the Peruvian Andes,<eos>
<bos>or drill small holes.<eos>
<bos>So this hole in his head enables Rev.<eol>Orison to help these prisoners escape?<eos>
<bos>Yeah. The practitioners of this...<eos>
<bos>found that they could perform<eol>certain mental tricks.<eos>
<bos>One of which they called<eol>"stopping the world."<eos>
<bos>Nobody can stop the world. I don't care<eol>how many holes they have in their head.<eos>
<bos>But maybe they can<eol>alter perception of it,<eos>
<bos>But why? I mean, even if you could, why?<eos>
<bos>Donny Faster is serving a life sentence<eol>without possibility of parole.<eos>
<bos>or in the eyes of a man<eol>who thinks he's God's tool.<eos>
<bos>Well, then if Rev. Orison<eol>meant to kill Donny Faster,<eos>
<bos>then why is he still alive?<eos>
<bos>I don't know. Maybe he unleashed<eol>something that he couldn't control.<eos>
<bos>Maybe he thought he was<eol>opening the door of perception,<eos>
<bos>but then unwittingly<eol>he... opened the gates of hell.<eos>
<bos>What?<eos>
<bos>Glory. Amen. Glory. Amen.<eos>
<bos>- Glory. Amen.<eos>
<bos>Are you Donald?<eos>
<bos>Yes.<eos>
<bos>I'm from Tip Top Gentlemen Service.<eos>
<bos>This isn't your place, is it?<eos>
<bos>- No. Why?<eol>- 'Cause I was coming up the stairs...<eos>
<bos>and got stopped by the landlord,<eol>like it's any of his business.<eos>
<bos>He told me some Rev. Orison lives here.<eos>
<bos>- Now, you ain't no preacher, are you?<eol>- No.<eos>
<bos>Good. They always like<eol>the weirdest things.<eos>
<bos>You know what I mean?<eos>
<bos>- You okay? - Yes.<eos>
<bos>Something you wanna say?<eos>
<bos>Love your hair.<eos>
<bos>What are you doin'?<eos>
<bos>Is your hair chemically treated?<eos>
<bos>My hair?<eos>
<bos>I don't know which product to use.<eos>
<bos>Look, you're not usin' no product.<eol>I'm clean, my hair's clean.<eos>
<bos>Well, be a gentleman and get me a towel.<eol>I'm gonna get out of here.<eos>
<bos>It's a wig.<eos>
<bos>They lied to me.<eos>
<bos>You lied to me!<eos>
<bos>- Where'd he go? - Marshal?<eos>
<bos>- Marshal? - What?<eos>
<bos>The prisoner, the man you were guarding<eol>in this room, what happened to him?<eos>
<bos>He's gone, Scully.<eol>So is the marshal's gun.<eos>
<bos>You didn't see him?<eos>
<bos>Let's go, Scully.<eos>
<bos>-  What is it? - What does this mean?<eos>
<bos>- Did you tell him?<eol>- No, I only told you.<eos>
<bos>He must have, uh, overheard us<eol>when we were talking in the hallway.<eos>
<bos>I didn't mention the name of the song.<eos>
<bos>- I'm sure you did.<eol>- No, I'm sure I didn't, Mulder.<eos>
<bos>Well, maybe this was meant for you.<eos>
<bos>"Don't look any further."<eos>
<bos>"Whosoever sheddeth man's blood,<eos>
<bos>by man shall his blood be shed."<eos>
<bos>What are you doing?<eos>
<bos>Taking you home.<eos>
<bos>"The wicked will be punished."<eos>
<bos>Pray for God's love, Donny.<eos>
<bos>Find the humility in yourself<eol>to allow God into your heart.<eos>
<bos>All you have to do is believe.<eos>
<bos>Repent.<eos>
<bos>You'll feel God's love come to show you<eol>the way to His heavenly kingdom.<eos>
<bos>Are you sorry for what you've done?<eos>
<bos>You...<eos>
<bos>What did you say?<eos>
<bos>Never... No...<eos>
<bos>No...<eos>
<bos>- Why are you crying? - I can't...<eos>
<bos>Beg His forgiveness<eol>for what you did to those girls,<eos>
<bos>for what you did to all<eol>those poor helpless girls.<eos>
<bos>My violence is always<eol>waiting for an instant...<eos>
<bos>for when His back is turned.<eos>
<bos>You can see it now.<eos>
<bos>Are you crying for your sins...<eol>or for yourself?<eos>
<bos>No, Reverend.<eos>
<bos>I cry for you.<eos>
<bos>Because you cannot kill me.<eos>
<bos>You know, it's funny.<eol>When all is said and done, there's...<eos>
<bos>not much mystery in murder.<eos>
<bos>And for that,<eol>I owe you an apology, Mulder.<eos>
<bos>- What do you mean?<eol>- Well, you were right.<eos>
<bos>I was looking too hard for connections<eol>that weren't there.<eos>
<bos>Orison was a murderer, plain and simple.<eos>
<bos>I guess in his own twisted way<eol>he was making good with his God.<eos>
<bos>Glory. Amen. Let's go home, Scully.<eos>
<bos>Donny Faster placed the call<eol>to the police that led us out here.<eos>
<bos>It's almost like he's<eol>begging us to hunt him down.<eos>
<bos>This X-File is over. Lying dead there<eol>in a grave he dug himself.<eos>
<bos>Let's let the U.S. Marshals<eol>take over from here.<eos>
<bos>Don't look any further, Scully.<eos>
<bos>- This is Fox Mulder.<eol>Leave a message after the...<eos>
<bos>- Agent Mulder,<eol>MarshalJoe Danno in Marion.<eos>
<bos>I just talked to a call girl who I.D. 'd<eol>Donny Faster as an attacker.<eos>
<bos>Claims Faster got real upset<eol>when she was wearing a red wig...<eos>
<bos>upset she wasn't a redhead.<eos>
<bos>This mean anything to you?<eol>I'd appreciate a call back.<eos>
<bos>Go back to hell!<eos>
<bos>- Who does your nails, girly girl?<eol>- Let me go!<eos>
<bos>The only reason why you're alive<eol>is because I asked the judge for life!<eos>
<bos>You're the one that got away.<eos>
<bos>- You're all I think about.<eol>- I'm a federal agent.<eos>
<bos>You do anything to me and they<eol>will not give you a break this time.<eos>
<bos>I'm going to run you a bath.<eos>
<bos>Don't look any further<eos>
<bos>Now, be good and don't<eol>cause me any problems.<eos>
<bos>Someone to count on<eos>
<bos>In a world ever changing<eos>
<bos>Here I am Stop where you're standing<eos>
<bos>What you need is a lover<eos>
<bos>Someone to take over<eos>
<bos>- Oh, girl, don't look any further<eos>
<bos>And it's strange<eos>
<bos>Oh, baby<eos>
<bos>Don't look any further<eos>
<bos>Tonight<eos>
<bos>We're gonna take it<eos>
<bos>All night long, baby, daylight<eos>
<bos>Daylight<eos>
<bos>I'll still be lookin'<eol>in your heavenly eyes<eos>
<bos>And we'll go on and on<eos>
<bos>Don't look any further<eos>
<bos>Don't look any further<eos>
<bos>Someone to count on<eos>
<bos>In a world ever changing<eos>
<bos>Here I am, baby<eos>
<bos>Stop right where you're standing<eos>
<bos>What you need is a lover<eos>
<bos>Someone to take over<eos>
<bos>Here I am, baby Don't look any further<eos>
<bos>Further<eos>
<bos>- Excuse me. -  Yeah, sure.<eos>
<bos>If you want to pack some things,<eol>we can get out of here.<eos>
<bos>- You can't judge yourself.<eos>
<bos>Maybe I don't have to.<eos>
<bos>The Bible allows for vengeance.<eos>
<bos>But the law doesn't.<eos>
<bos>The way I see it,<eol>he didn't give you a choice.<eos>
<bos>And my report will reflect that,<eos>
<bos>in case you're worried.<eos>
<bos>Donny Faster would have surely<eol>killed again if given the chance.<eos>
<bos>He was evil, Mulder.<eos>
<bos>I'm sure about that without a doubt.<eos>
<bos>But there's one thing<eol>that I'm not sure of.<eos>
<bos>What's that?<eos>
<bos>Who was at work in me?<eos>
<bos>Or what?<eos>
<bos>What made me...<eos>
<bos>What made me pull the trigger?<eos>
<bos>You mean if it was God?<eos>
<bos>I mean, what if it wasn't?<eos>
